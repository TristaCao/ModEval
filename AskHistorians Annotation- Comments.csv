Depth,"It went in and out - men mostly wore short hair in republican Rome, medieval East Africa, and Maoist China, but not in the Sikh Punjab, Restoration England, or the 19th-century Great Plains.

In the US, short hair became the social norm for men around the early 19th century, but even then you can find a lot of hairstyles that seem unusual to most people today.
",
Depth,"Started? That is tough. It was well and underway during the crisis of the 3rd Century. Gaulic dress and other ""exotic"" things were very much en vogue among the upper class since the 1st century.

Keep in mind Greek was the language of the Empire, and Latin was pretty much just the ""official"" language. People who you pay taxes to, and get paid taxes from spoke Latin. The upper echelons did because they studied rhetoric and it was the official language. The vast, vast majority of the empire outside of the Italin penninsula spoke their own languages. Greek was by far the most common. Greek colonies in Syracuse would be a significant cultural factor throughout its history.

Roman culture was one of statecraft and violence. Aside from that they were incredibly adaptable and resilient. As Gaul became more integrated, Rome saw more Gauls. By the time of the Marian Reforms, Latin was spoken to and by officers but German dialects were spoken between the ranks.

Rome and Latin was the political glue that held it all together. The day-to-day lives and culture of 90% of people passing around Ceasers coin changed in their own directions. Little of it due to Roman hedgemony.

Over time Rome became the legions. Under Marius the legions were mostly non-Italians. And pretty much all of this is due to self interested senators caring more about their individual property than any lessons history taught them.",

Clutter,A pleasure to read. Thank you VERY much!,
Sources,"No, and yes.

Watch Terry Gilliam's Medieval Lives series or the YouTube Channel Modern History TV, they both cover this in detail.

The short version is that you can't apply modern ideas of poverty and cleanliness to the medieval era. They did wash and clean their houses and their clothes, but they also were happy using chamber pots and sharing living spaces with animals, and they didn't have modern detergents or soaps or deodorants. But then again neither did modern people until after about World War 2. In the same way we would consider having to grow your own food and living in a communal space with your extended family ""poor"" but that was normal both then and well into the modern era for many people outside of towns.

""Degenerate"" is such a loaded term that it's not even worth considering. They were mostly deeply religious and would consider much of what we do as sinful and degenerate.

So those aspects of stereotypical medieval portrayals aren't really accurate. However, disease and starvation were ever present problems in the times before vaccination, antibiotics, disinfectants, germ theory and artificial pesticides and fertilizers. People disfigured by disease would have been a common sight, leprosy (easily curable today) was common, and starvation was only a war, a long winter, a rainy summer or a crop or animal disease away for many people. But again, these were problems well into the modern era, just look at the Irish famine, the Spanish flu or the aftermath of many wars.

Bizarre as it may sound, trials against pets and pests were not uncommon in Medieval times. The idea originated directly from the Greek belief that crimes should always be properly expiated, even when committed by a beast — or even an inanimate object. Failing to do so would enrage the furies, and bring famine and disease on the land. Chronicler Pausanias recalls how a bust of the poet Theognis toppled and fell on a man, smashing his head, and a statue of famous athlete Theagenes was knocked over by a rival and killed him. Both offending statues were banished from Athens and thrown into the sea — after a proper trial, of course. It was believed, by medieval authorities, that crimes committed by “all beasts and birds, as well as creeping things” were the devil’s work: letting them go unpunished would provide an opportunity for the devil to take over human affairs. Medieval theology simply substituted the furies of classical mythology with the biblical demons, and the tradition continued with bizarre trials to corpses (the dead body of Pope Formosus was propped up on a throne and put on the stand in 896) and farm animals (a sow was finely dressed in men’s clothing and hauled into court in 1386, and a rooster accused of laying eggs was burned at the stake in 1474).

Animal trials were no joke: they were serious, official proceedings that could last months and employed respected lawyers on both sides. Superstitious aspect aside, the social utility of such trials was real: according to lawyer Paul Schiff Berman they allowed the community to “domesticate chaos by providing a consensus explanation of social reality to replace what would otherwise seem to be frightening and uncontrollable activity. Chaotic and painful events are thus brought under human jurisdiction.”

According to Italian jurist Carlo D’Addosio, crimes fell under different jurisdictions depending on the kind of animal accused of it. Farm animals (cows, pigs, dogs, horses and the like) were tried in civil and criminal courts; vermin (rats, moles, weasels, field mice) and “pestiferous creatures” (beetles, frogs, flies, grasshoppers, leeches, snails, worms, but also snakes and eels) fell under the all-inclusive power of the ecclesiastical tribunals. Why the distinction, you may ask? Well, creatures who were in the service of man (and subject to man’s control) could be arrested, tried, and executed like any other member of the household; rats and bugs, on the other hand, escaped the realm of human intervention. God himself sent frogs, locusts and flies to scare the crap out of Egyptians: only he could call them off. Aside from that, it can be pretty hard to detain a swarm of wasps or termites",
No plagiarism,"It is said that Bjørn Ironside (bjørn means bear, and ironside... gives sense.), already had an interest to find new land, like Ragnar Lothbrok, told by the famous Muslim historian and geographer from Andalusia Abu Abdullah Al-Bakri, he tells that in his book of ""books of roads and kingdoms"" (kitab al-masalik wa-al-mamalik) that the danish vikings (not the norwegian ones they mostly went to Ireland), raided the city of Nekor located in modern day Morocco, they also held multiple slaves in morocco, for rowing back.

The way they found Morocco, is that vikings ended up folowing their famous raids in spain, they had no intend of clashing with the Muslim Caliphate of Andalusia (north africa), they attacked Lisbon (Portugal's capital) and sevilla, where they aswell took many fortunes, goods, as well as women and children.

second time when invading Morocco they lost, and since the nordic belief of fighting is you die to your death, if not you will go to valhalla (nordic mythology heaven),

Following their defeat in the coast of Andalusia, many of the Vikings captured were punished while a minority converted to Islam and were allowed to settle in the city of Jerez de la Frontera, in the province of Cádiz.",
Clutter,This seems like an obvious attempt to start drama and not at all a legitimate question.,
No speculation,"That's a loaded question. As it often goes in war, everyone points the finger at the other side for doing all the atrocities. The Russians blame Napoleon, Napoleon blames Russia, each say they gave the order to the prisoners.

There is no evidence Napoleon ordered Moscow burned. Rumors and accusations, sure, but no evidence. Napoleon also had no motive to destroy a city he intended to occupy - that would destroy whatever supplies were left, and only force him to leave earlier. Another urban legend is that Napoleon ordered the Kremlin to be blown up on retreat as revenge and only a ""miraculous"" rain stopped it by extinguishing the gunpowder fuses. Makes for a good patriotic story, and reinforces the ""God is on our side"" trope.

Napoleon was many bad things, but he was not a ruthless vandal. If someone was to accuse him of looting Moscow's arts and treasures and hauling them back to France, I'd believe that in an instant (he did that everywhere he went, using it to help pay for his war effort). But destroying stuff for the sake of destruction? That would just undermine his image of trying to appear as the more ""civilized"" one compared to the ""Backwards Muscovites.""

As for the fires, my guess is that they were started naturally via widespread looting and anarchy (by both the French Army and the prisoners/civilians, as often happens once the government flees and nobody polices the streets). Some would light fires to cook food or keep warm, and neglect their safety. The French would likely be indifferent to the fires, and not spend effort trying to put them out. Moscow at the time was mostly build using wood, and thus a fire would easily get out of control.)

As for the whole ""Atomic bomb"" aspect, very few people outside of the scientists, select witnesses,and high ranking members of the US military/government even knew it was being developed... until after it was dropped. And event then afterward it wasn't until the aftermath was studied that we knew what the aftermath of dropping a bomb on a city would be. Most of what we know about how extremely awful these weapons are, comes from studying the aftermath of the explosions in Japan.

Here is when/where the US public was informed of the Bombing of Hiroshima and the existence of Nuclear weapons on the 6th of August:

Do not just post links or quotations,"I'm not a historian, just a casual fan of history. I do know that in at least some states if the U.S. adultery is still a crime, although I've never heard of anyone being charged with it. I live in Minnesota and it's a gross misdemeanor here. In the Minnesota criminal code it's listed as a crime against the family along with bigamy, incest, non support of spouse or child, neglect and torture of a child.

609.36 ADULTERY.

Subdivision 1.Acts constituting.

 When a married woman has sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband, whether married or not, both are guilty of adultery and may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year or to payment of a fine of not more than $3,000, or both.

Subd. 2.Limitations.

No prosecution shall be commenced under this section except on complaint of the husband or the wife, except when such husband or wife lacks the mental capacity, nor after one year from the commission of the offense.

Subd. 3.Defense.

 It is a defense to violation of this section if the marital status of the woman was not known to the defendant at the time of the act of adultery.

Also fornication is still illegal in Minnesota but again I've never heard of anyone actually charged with it. Unlike adultery, fornication is listed under sex crimes but is a misdemeanor instead of a gross misdemeanor.

609.34 FORNICATION.

When any man and single woman have sexual intercourse with each other, each is guilty of fornication, which is a misdemeanor.

So really the only difference between the two is whether the woman is married or not.

I can't speak for any other states or countries but I'm sure it could be looked up. As for why it changed over time I couldn't speak on that either.",

Sources,"It mostly had to do with anti-corruption and inflation. Contrary to popular belief, the Tiannamen protestors were not seeking the overthrow of the Communist Party. They wanted it to reform itself.

The Tiannamen protests started, initially, with the funeral of Hu Yaobang, the former General Secretary of the Communist Party and who urged the Communist Party to reform itself. For instance, he carried out an anti-corruption campaign which targeted the children of prominent Party members.

When Yaobang's reformism led to the outbreak of protests in 1987, he was denounced by the Party as a 'bourgeois liberal' after he refused to expel the leaders of the protests from the Party. As such, he was forced to resign in disgrace, but this only made him more popular with the people. He was allowed to keep his seat in the Politburo, but he was effectively a persona non grata as far as the Party was concerned until 2005, after he had died.

When he died, his funeral was attended by thousands of people and those people became the nucleus for the students, academics, journalists and even Party members who would participate in the Tiannamen Square protests, which eventually grew to over a million people.

No speculation,"Could possibly be accurate lol. To put it into context. Ancient Rome had running water and sanitation. In many (most?) places in Europe they wouldn't have that again until after the industrial revolution.

By contrast Tenochtilan, the capital of the Aztec empire (modern day Mexico city) had sophisticated civic planning, an aqueduct system and such lavish gardens that the Spanish literally wrote of the fresh and flowery fragrance upon arrival, which was the exact opposite of the smell of death that accompanied most European metropolises of the time.

Clutter,Can we please get a picture of an Egyptian cat smoking a pipe?,
No political agendas or moralising ,"My answer applies only to North America:

The indigenous peoples of North America had suffered a major population decline in the decades immediately preceding major European settlement. The Europeans essentially encountered indigenous populations that had just suffered a large scale, unrelated demographic contraction. Remember, technologically speaking these were pre-modern peoples and were thus very much at the mercy of disease and seasonal effects to an even greater degree than the Europeans were. This was of course compounded by the epidemics that ran roughshod through these populations after European contact.

Even before Plymouth Rock and Jamestown, these were already low-density populations. The reason for this- and the reason the Europeans quickly outbred them- lies in the contrast between hunter-gatherer societies and agricultural societies. The Native Americans, as hunter gatherers, generally are only able to acquire enough resources to maintain, or slightly increase, their population. This is because they are always on the move and get a relatively low resource yield relative to the amount of effort expended. Agricultural societies like the Europeans’, however, generate much more food and are geographically stable (settled in one area versus moving around), thus enabling much faster population growth.

The infamously devastating diseases suffered by the natives as a result of European contact was itself a result of this meeting of different cultures. Most of these diseases were originally animal-borne. The Europeans, being settled peoples who had lived in close proximity to livestock for many centuries, had developed a certain level of resistance to these diseases. The Native Americans did not live alongside animals, thus had little natural resistance.

On a related note to the above, the “Agricultural Revolution” thousands of years ago was one of the major inflection points of human history, even more so than the Industrial Revolution. It wasn’t until civilizations started settling in one area and focusing on growing their own crops and livestock that earth’s homo sapien population really started to explode.",
"No partial answers or ""placeholders","While I can't pass final judgment on the truthfulness of Herman and Porter's piece in full, it's important to recognise that the arguments taking place in this 1975 article are still ones taking place in ongoing scholarship about the war in Vietnam, almost 50 years later. The article may be entitled ""The Myth of the Hue massacre"", but it would be a mistake to view this as a straightforward discussion about how many people died at Hue and under what circumstances. Hue, and the contentions over how many Vietnamese died and who killed them, still hold an important place in pro/anti-Vietnam war arguments. For those who believe the Vietnam war to have been a just cause, the massacre at Hue is an example of the horrors committed by the foes American forces fought against.

What I can help with is drawing a picture of the broader landscape of war, atrocity, propaganda, and the difficulties of reporting truth during the war in Vietnam. My angle here comes from having studied war reporting of the My Lai massacre in March 1968, an atrocity that (and this is important) didn't come to light in America until November 1969.

I don't have the stats for radio or telephone ownership in Dutch households in 1940 but bear in mind that the Netherlands was a world leader in radio manufacture (Philips of Eindhoven), that it's a small country and no one is particularly isolated, and that even the most remote Dutch farmer would have been aware of the ongoing war and the invasions of Denmark and Norway less than a month before.

I'd find it extraordinary if, with the exception of people living literally on the border, there was any section of Dutch society that wasn't acutely aware of the invasion before it reached them.",

Okay,"This is usually a question that students of archaeology, rather than history, stumble upon sooner rather than later. In my case the cat question was related to the 'mother goddess' at Catal Höyük and similar figures from different eras. The question went along the lines of ""Was there really a wide-scale worship of big-breasted mothergodesses or were these figures just early porn?"". The short snippet on the linked site opens up what I'll try to elaborate on in this post - namely how archaeologists and historians to a lesser degree come up with their theories. My field of study used to be Near Eastern Archaeology, so I won't be able to go into the specifics of egyptian cat cults, but I'll try to give a small overview as to how archaeolgists end up with certain interpretations.

As a basis, we have to keep in mind that we're building our knowledge on hundreds of years of research which has been in a state of flux. Speaking in general, archaeologists, and historians to some degree, only establish theories. We find things and create theories that can change over time. A consensus might or might not be reached and might possibly change when new information comes to light, be it due to new digs, new texts or even new technologies used to analyze previously discarded evidence.

A prime example would be Winckelmann's Studies (1760's) on Greek and Roman statues, which were based on the idea that the state we found them in (unpainted, perfectly white) was their intended state. When he published his interpretation, it became a popular opinion that pure white statues were the epitome of beauty. In his opinion, colors found on statues were signs of barbarian abnormalties and not the intended way the artists made them. His publication ""The History of Art in Antiquity"" in turn influenced a lot of neo-classical art, which is why many people still view pure white marble statues as peak beauty. Nowadays, we know that most statues and buildings were painted - some even rather gaudy for our own tastes (examples). It still took a rather long time for the consensus to switch, or rather to reach the public and not be limited to scientific circles.

In a similar, more recent case, when Klaus Schmidt started to publish his findings from Göbekli Tepe (2001 for the preliminary reports of the first few seasons), he suggested that they were purely sacred sites with only temporary inhabitants. Quasi a pre-historical Mekka where hunter-gatherers gathered occasionally. This had rather large implications for (local) history, as it would mean that before hunter-gatherer socities (permanently) settled in the area, they had already started to create permanent places with sacred (thus the interpretation as shrines) or social functions. Schmidt later revised this and suggested that there might have been some permanent personel on site. The most famous counter to Schmidt's early theories came in 2011 by Edward Banning who suggested we're basing our opinion on incomplete research and maybe we're just looking at symbol-rich houses. And even 20 years after Schmidts first publication, there's no ""100%"" answer as to what exactly Göbekli Tepe was. There's some general consensus based on the found architectual remains as well as small finds or rather the general lack of certain small finds that would be indicative of permanent settlement. But due to the nature of archaeology (you can only dig so much), it's enterily possible that we're one dig season away from scrapping all that, though the focus of the dig has shifted since Schmidt's death in 2014, imo for the worse, towards a more small-scale approach so we'll probably never really know.

And this is where your question comes in again. For most of prehistory and early history, we're basing our opinions on material finds. Ideally, we cross-reference in the same time or shortly after (for Göbekli Tepe Schmidt's ""Sie Bauten die Ersten Tempel"" from 2009 does exactly that), try to slot it into overarching developments that have been established (like this series on architectual history [there's more books labled studies 4 and 5] by the Max Planck institute, in german) and then to make educated guesses based on this. But they more often then not remain guesses - even in times were we have written records, it's not very often that we get explicit texts on what something was intended for but that's another can of worms. These guesses are, in the most optimal cases, backed by evidence and the later in time we get, the more kinds of records we can use to back our guesses and the more sure we can be that we're correct. So we can't 100% rule out that cat-worship in ancient egypt was all an elaborate, wide-scale hoax. But we can make a pretty good guess that this wasn't the case. If we ever find evidence of it being a hoax, we can adjust the theory, much like Schmidt (or the team at Catal Höyük) did to a certain degree or how Winkelmanns ideas have been challenged and adjusted.

On a very much less serious note, David Macauly created a great book in 1979 called Motel of the Mysteries, where life in North America got wiped out in 1984 and archaeologists hundreds of years later are interpreting bedrooms as burial chambers and toilets as sacred urns. The book plays on the stereotypical idea that whatever archaeologists find, it's always a burial site, a temple or palace - which is something that used to happen a lot in older digs. It's a good example why we need to adjust our theories, as it's ok to interpret a large building as a palace but if you know there's generally only one or maybe a few palaces and you find 28 of the same kind of building, it gets a bit tricky to justify ""Palace A-Z"" in your publication.",Is it possible with ancient cultures that we are falsely misled to think they took their beliefs entirely seriously?

No speculation,"Medieval people were homosapiens like us, with the same skin, same nervous system, and same brain as us. More ignorant, sure, but my point is if you feel uncomfortable when you're dirty, they did too. They could probably tolerate a different amount of body odor and had a different idea of how dirty you had to be to bathe, because we can just turn a tap in our homes and get hot water - they had to pay to go to a bath house where bathmaids had a fire constantly making hot water (not cheap).

Another good thing to remember is that our understanding of them is filtered through the lens of the intervening centuries. Scholars (and therefore the people who wrote the history books) from the Renaissance onward venerated the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome as ""enlightened"" and referred to the medieval era as the ""dark ages"". This attitude proliferated into common thought, so naturally many representations of the middle ages reflect that bias.",
Depth,"Totally. Except with the forced labor. Thomas Jefferson was raised in Shadwell, Virginia along side a slave born the same year, 1743, named Jupiter Evans, who would stay Jefferson's ""bro"" for the rest of his life. Likewise, Andrew Jackson would send a child whose family had been killed by his troops in the Battle of Tallushatchee as part of the Creek Wars home to Rachel to be raised with his ""son"" Andrew Jr.

It was somewhat common for wealthy families to pair a slave child with their own as a companion. While they typically remained a servant they often were afforded special treatment. Jupiter was Jefferson's personal assistant and married his cook. Their child, Philip, would become a lifetime companion to Thomas Jefferson Randolph, grandson of TJ, with Randolph later saying Evans was;

    small, active, intelligent, much of a humourist, was my companion in childhood and friend through life

And later related two stories. In the first, he went with his father in the War of 1812 at 21 years old, taking Philip along. They left Evans behind in NY with three horses and rode ahead to join the army. Evans himself later told of the New Yorkers that advised him to sell the horses and seek freedom. He instead took them down the St Lawrence River, seeing the ""free"" bank of Canada across the water, until he reunited with his master several miles later. In the second story, Randolph fell to injury. Evans would ride to the next county for a doctor. When Randolph awoke, Evans was holding him with ""tears streaming from his eyes."" By all accounts, they were friends.

So yes, bro slaves existed.

Edit to add: Jackson had aspirations of Lyncoya attending west point. He was seen somewhere between slave and white, so not quite as direct a comparison.
",
No personal anecdotes,"Sure. I grew up in a coal mining company town in West Virginia.

Company executives didn't live in company towns. The executives generally lived out of state - which is one of the reasons why the state is in such bad shape now. All the profit from coal mining went elsewhere.

There was usually a big, two story house where the mine superintendent lived. Depending on the size of the mine there might be two of these. Around that would be the foreman's houses, which were usually nice places but only one story. The company store and usually the company doctor's office would be part of the same cluster, and usually would be upwind of the railroad tracks and closest to the main road.

The miner's homes were often what we'd call 'duplexes'. One house with four rooms, split down the middle. Each family had two rooms. Two front doors, two back doors, two outhouses out back. One big front porch. When the unions broke the stranglehold the company had on the miners, the coal companies gradually got out of the landlord business. When my grandfather came back from the Pacific when WW2 was over, he bought the house he'd been renting from the company, built a door between the two front rooms, and sealed up one of the front doors.

No speculation,"Human beings have in the modern age made recordings of such events...also a comet hitting Jupiter.

The only time there's a reasonable chance of seeing this is during a lunar eclipse when there's not as much competing light. Even then it's not going to be visible with the naked eye (unlike distant stars going supernova, we have evidence that ancient people observed, discussed, and made art about it).

Is it possible that some of the early astronomers were looking at the moon during a lunar eclipse when this happened and saw it?

Well I think it's likely if you were an early astronomer you'd be looking at the moon during a lunar eclipse rather than let the opportunity slip by.

But to happen to see an impact big enough to be seen, while looking at the right spot? (After all, we've captured just a few with modern tech) that's highly unlikely.

And what's even more unlikely is that they'd keep quiet about it. Rennisance astronomers wrote letters to each-other discussing such stuff and wrote books and papers for various early colleges, royal science academia, etc",
No Current events ,"When I went to the US (from the UK) I found the US portion size in restaurant's was larger then the UK. But not by much. They are certainly larger then serving size I have had in Asia, but again I was never hungry in Asia.

Studies have been done in the UK about serving size. They studied both white and Asian (ie Indian/Pakistani/Bengali) families and portion size. Portion size has increased dramatically over the last few generations and has had noticeable affects. Both the white British and Asian British food was relatively healthy in its portion size up to the 1970s, after which time incomes rose as did purchasing power and availability of foods. This increased portion size and created large numbers of people with obesity, heart disease and diabetes. But that is more to do with portion size and obesity in the UK.

The US was similar. After WWII they the US came out rich and wealthy so could afford to have larger portions. Europe had had major problems with suppling food, and severe shortages and rationing till the 1950s (the Soviet union had had a famine in 1946 and 1947). This resulted in portions being small due to the fact that is all they could afford/get hold of. As the US had become accustomed to larger portions in the '40s and '50s it was almost impossible to go back. If you were served portions that were smaller at restaurants you were seen as being a rip off, served smaller portions at home you were seen as being cheap, or more importantly unsuccessful (ie not American). So the food industry in the US as such has been geared towards large food portions, even at the expense of quality. For example much of the American meat produced is not allowed into the EU due to the way its produced, designed for quick but large animal production.",
Okay,"The name ""Etat Français"" does not seem to have been actually thought out. It was something as a placeholder meant to replace the name of the despised République. It is in fact a generic term for referring to the French State as a State: people pay taxes to the State, not to the Republic. That was the case before 1940 and it is still the case today (eg this page on the official website of the French government). Calling the new regime ""French State"" is a little bit like calling your dog ""Dog"". The official name of France, of course, was, and still is, the République Française.

On 9 July 1940, the French National Assembly (Chamber of Deputies + Senate) gathered in Vichy adopted a resolution to revise the Constitution, and the next day, it voted for a Constitutional Law that gave Pétain full government powers, and notably authorized him to draft a new Constitution. Pétain then published the Acte Constitutionel N°2 that defined his now extensive powers and named him Chef de l'Etat Français, ie Head of the French State, which is a bland way to call the Head of the French State. The French Republic was de facto (but not officially) abolished and the new State was supposed to be temporary until a new constitution was established. The new constitution was never written so the temporary regime became permanent.

For a while, the new regime was called by the newspapers the ""new French State"" and the ""Etat Français"" name was progressively officially introduced in letterheads, stamps, and official documents, replacing République Française just like busts of Pétain replaced busts of Marianne in town halls: on 4 January 1941, the government gazette Journal Officiel de la République Française was retitled Journal Officiel de l'Etat Français. But State Prosecutors were still named Procureurs de la République throughout the war!

Stamps examplified the fleeting nature of the Etat Français monicker: stamps with RF (République Française) were still produced until July 1941, when RF disappeared from the stamps to be replaced by the non-committal ""Postes Françaises"". The only public stamps (not made for the administration) with ""Etat Français"" were a series published in April 1943 dedicated to Pétain and to the ""Travail Famille Patrie"" motto. ""RF"" came back on the stamps as soon as the Gaullists were in power.

The Vichy regime was fundamentally centered on the personality of Pétain, not on the Etat Français which stayed in the background as far as propaganda was concerned. Pétain was the State (echoeing Louis XIV's ""L'Etat c'est moi"", I am the State) and his image was the actual ""logotype"" of the new regime. This is fundamentally different from the Republic, which is distinct from the State: Emmanuel Macron is the chef de l'Etat and the Président de la République.

No plagiarism,"The Greeks did indeed come from Greece, but they adopted a lot from the Middle East, to the point that many, many things associated with Greece (math, mass political participation, architecture, philosophy, etc) were actually previously developed in the Middle East or India. Greek civilization also developed gradually, but from 2000+ years of distance it looks sort of flat to us.

The other issue is that western culture is built on idolizing aspects of Greek and Roman cultures, so there are lots of Greek thinkers considered great because our idea of a great thinker is essentially someone who values what Greeks valued (I am shamelessly cribbing off an r/AskHistorians comment here but sadly forget which one). For example, “great thinkers” of 19th century history tend to be men from privileged backgrounds who pontificated publicly about Big Questions like Marx or Lincoln, as opposed to people who thought deeply in private and kept their innermost selves close like Emily Dickinson, or treasured learning but became powerless, learned to fear God and man alike and do what it took to survive like Omar ibn Said.",

Just as a thought experiment pretend you are a dude who needs to get some rest and relaxation in Roman times. I’m going to lay out a day of your vacation and I want you to think about what is real and what is some modern thing I’ve transported back in time to your Ancient vacation:
-You’re in a seaside resort town, it’s the party season and people travel here to get wasted on the beach, cut loose and do crazy stuff, like an Iron Age Las Vegas.
-You wake up in a hotel.
-You go take a nice hot bath.
-After that you’re hungry so you go grab some fast food from the fast food place on the street.
-As you’re chowing down on your ancient equivalent of a Big Mac you walk through the town square and see a big advertisement on the side of a building for a race and gladiator game happening later today.
-You decide to attend this happening and have a great time so naturally you buy a sports jersey advertising one of the charioteers you saw.
-It’s night so you go get drunk at a bar then head back to your hotel to sleep it off, after all you have a show to catch tomorrow.

All that stuff was real! Roman fast food? We’ve found almost complete ruins of fast food restaurants. Billboard style ads for local games and events? We’ve found those too. Sports jerseys? We have the price tags from them. The part about there being a vacation party city where people went to get crazy? That’s Baiae, you can go walk around the ruins today and look at all the cool stuff (too be fair you could also be in one of many resort towns in the Gulf of Naples).
A lot was different in the past but in many ways things were pretty similar, often in ways we don’t think of.

The vast majority of the rank-and-file functionaries remained intact, and many, in fact, remained in post-war German leadership posts, as the Western Powers were desperate to keep some semblance of a state strong enough to resist Communism, even at the cost of keeping much of those supporting a militarized far-right regime in power.

The less known part is that in the 60s, there was a second wave of Denazification in Germany, except this time it was led by the Germans themselves. Like many other things in life, it was driven by a generational shift, and part of the 1960s protest wave (e.g. the concurrent Civil Rights / Vietnam / Hippies in the US, or the French student protests). German youth gained a voice and started demanding accountability from its own leaders regarding its past crimes, and this time the process was a lot more thorough (since, being domestic, it couldn't be attacked by critics as a ""foreign diktat""), with actually purging most of the ex-Nazis and their associates from power, leading to the kind of German political landscape we know today.",

Okay,"

This is a bigger question than you might think! The culture around weapons and training in the medieval period was largely informal, and so instruction was at once easy to come by but not coherent or consistent, and was largely driven by peerage networks and class dynamics.

Let's start out with your first question: you've heard of Fiore, a famous fencing instructor, and you want to become a better fencer. This already implies a bit about you - you're likely from a class for whom martial skill was an expectation, and so you'd likely spent a good deal of your youth in unstructured martial play, as well as directed personal training, from a friend, relative, or other skilled community member. By the late 14th century, men of non-noble classes were increasingly bearing the martial burden of Christendom, and mercenaries from various Italian states were frequently present in wars waged all over Europe and the Levant. The Swiss and the Holy Roman Empire, too, were exporting mercenaries, many of whom were drawn from the artisan classes, men whose towns or cities expected them to bear arms in their defense, and so had grown up with the expectation to wield weapons with skill. Friuli, the area Fiore was originally from, was a part of the Empire, and as such the cities therein were organized on an imperial pattern, so whether or not your specific class of man was responsible for bearing arms or not was up either to your town Rat, or ecclesiastical or secular lord. Local laws were hyper-local, the only consistency being that, generally, if you were a noble of any income level, or a citizen of a state or city, chances are you spent a good deal of your youth playing martial games suited to whatever class you were a part of. Citizens would be expected to carry halberds or some sort of polearm - not only for fighting but also for firefighting, a perennial risk in late medieval cities - own armor, and carry a sidearm as well. Depending on the city or particular town organization, you might substitute the polearm for a crossbow or a firearm. Which meant that you'd practice with those weapons in various martial games and training exercises.

These games were sportive and competitive, but were meant to encourage men to practice on their own time and at their own expense. Archery contests between archery guilds were popular, and might take place during a city fair or a market day, when travelers from the countryside would meet up, and there they'd set up butts to shoot at, a field in which to wrestle and fence. Noblemen, of course, fought in tournaments, at jousting and at the barriers, in foot combats and mounted melees and half a hundred variations. Martial games were the training regimen of the 14th and 15th centuries. This was how you prepared for war; by playing at it. And by playing at it, you got better at it, and warfare itself in many ways resembled the playing, until the lines between ""real combat"" and preparation for it became blurry. The performance, in other words, was the point.

To get better at all this, medieval writers knew that one must also train the body, and many recommended exercises that included throwing stones - Pietro Monte, a 15th century writer, warrior, and traveler, gave extensive advice on how to throw stones for the best effect - running and hiking, riding, jumping and leaping, and even swimming. Dancing, too, was often recommended, as a practice that would teach coordination, nimbleness, and grace, all qualities that were expected of fencers. Art that depicts peasant weddings and market days often included young men wrestling in play, brawling, or fencing, as well as folk dancing of various kinds. A particular artistic milieu called the Planetenkinder or Children of the Planets often depicted young athletes as Children of the Sun.

All of which is to say that if you've heard of Fiore, you'd likely already be pretty experienced as a fencer and as a wrestler, at least in a sort of provincial, intuitive sense. Civic authorities were ""keen to encourage able-bodied men to train in using weapons of war for the purposes of state security."" Lacking standing armies or perpetually embodied police forces, a state's security rested on the interested members of the community, the citizenry, to protect it themselves. What that doesn't mean is that there was any consciously constructed infrastructure for this training. Instead, just like with every other learned skill or art, you would have to learn much by yourself, until you could find and hire an expert to instruct you. In the mercantile and artisan worlds, this was done through apprenticeship and travel, and based on Fiore's - and many other Fechtbucher authors' - writing, travel to learn from other instructors was a major part of learning to fence, too.

We've established that just about everyone fences. So what's the difference between the best fencer in town and someone like Fiore? What, in other words, is different between men who fence and fencers? There's much we can infer from various treatise writers, but in essence the constant reference to fencing as an art, as a particular valuable social skill, can be read as a means by which men like Fiore attempted to elevate the art. Fiore, just like every other author, clearly separates what he intends his students to learn from the common riffraff. As he puts it:

    I also desired to learn the wondrous secrets of this art known only by very few men in this world.

The art of the sword was secret, it was protected knowledge, and to learn how to fence was to be introduced into the mysteries of a particular art. You wouldn't just learn how to beat people with a sword, you'd be brought into a select social subgroup based on shared ideals and ideas of fencing. This subgroup had long been established in art and in language, as well; prior to the late 15th century the primary weapon associated with the social subgroup of fencers was the sword and buckler, a weapon pair that remained prominent in fencing books until the latter half of the 16th century. The longsword, or the sword held in two hands, was quickly becoming more prominent, and certainly by the time Fiore wrote his manuscript it had taken a place alongside the sword and buckler as the fencer's preferred weapon. By the early 16th century, the particular artistic use of the Feder (this is a retronym favored by the modern historical fencing community to denote a foiled training longsword, with distinct morphological features) had almost entirely replaced the sword and buckler as artistic shorthand for ""fencer.""

You would have known at least some of this. You wanted to learn how to fence not just for battlefield success or to perform well at tournaments or in market contests, but to enter into the mysteries of the sword. To train under Fiore, you gotta know him. That's really about all there is to it. You have to be in the same social groups as him, to know someone who knows someone who might introduce you. You'd have to find him when he has free time and the leisure to train someone. If he doesn't have time or doesn't feel like it, you're shit out of luck. But never fear! There were fencing instructors everywhere. Northern Italy was a battleground for states, cities, and empires for hundreds of years, and there was likely no lack of experienced men who'd be willing to teach a trick or two for some coin.

Now, if you knew him, if he was interested, and if you could work it out, we don't really know exactly what the training would entail. Would he teach you a cut or two and then stand there with his hand out, like a beggar asking for alms? Or would this be a dedicated, weeks-long effort to unteach you your bad provincial habits and replace them with the cruel physical intellect of the martial arts? We don't know. We only get very few references to training, and all they agree on was that it was likely done in small groups in private settings, not as a big class doing rote drills. One of the more prominent is a reference or two in, of all things, a costume book kept by Matthaus Schwarz in the early 16th century, which references his ""learning to fence"" in 1518, showing him holding a Feder in a small room. His cousin, who continued his costume book, has another, similar image, showing him and a couple of friends engage a fencing master. No details about the cost or the duration of the training, merely that it was done in private for individuals and small groups. We have no evidence to suggest anything like large-scale schools that would be the norm today. So, your fellow students likely look an awful lot like you.

Regarding women, one likely could, and girls likely grew up wrestling as much as boys did before they turned old enough that it was socially discouraged, and was likely discouraged for adult women.

As far as the church goes, they treated fencing just like they treated many martial pastimes: one the one hand it was violent and driven in no small part by pride, but on the other hand, Christendom needed the strong arm of the second estate to protect itself, and so it was a necessary evil in many ways. There is a great deal more we could get into about violence and the church, but I'm running out of space. Happy to answer follow ups!

Do not just post links or quotations,"It's quite real.

""The morning of the combat saw thousands of Parisians arriving at the Abbey at dawn, long before the appointed hour. Amongst the spectators were the King and his entourage, including his uncles John, Duke of Berry, Philip the Bold and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon as well as his brother the Duke of Orléans.[11] Also present, dressed in black and sitting in a carriage overlooking the field, was Marguerite. Should her husband lose the battle, she would be burned at the stake in Montfaucon immediately following the duel, having been thus ""proven"" guilty of perjury by its outcome.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_Carrouges#Trial_by_combat

Here is the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart account :

""The lady remained seated, making fervent prayers to God and the Virgin, entreating humbly, that through her grace and intercession, she might gain the victory according to her right. Her affliction was great, for her life depended on the event; and, should her husband lose the victory, she would have been burnt, and he would have been hanged. I am ignorant, for I never had any conversation with her or the knight, whether she had not frequently repented of having pushed matters so far as to place herself and husband in such peril; but it was now too late, and she must abide the event.""

""The two champions were then advanced, and placed opposite to each other; when they mounted their horses, and made a handsome appearance, for they were both expert men at arms. They ran their first course without hurt to either. After the tilting, they dismounted, and made ready to continue the fight. They behaved with courage; but sir John de Carogne was, at the first onset, wounded in the thigh, which alarmed all his friends: notwithstanding this, he fought so desperately that he struck down his adversary, and, thrusting his sword through the body, caused instant death; when he demanded of the spectators if he had done his duty: they replied that he had. The body of James le Gris was delivered to the hangman, who dragged it to Montfaucon, and there hanged it.""

Sidestepping the legal court verdict and asking God to settle a dispute wasn't something the authorities cared for, (this was in fact the last one). This was one of the ways to make sure you really really didn't accept worldly justice.",
No personal anecdotes,"I'm not a scholar of this subject the way a couple of my college profs were, but I'll share a few thoughts I still recall from the course I took called ""revolutionary china""

Now, it helps that the one professor I had was a Brit of Hong Kong descent, so he can read protest signs and whatnot. There's the additional aspect of the cultural familiarity he has. Finally, we have the benefit of looking at who came up from that era.

Per some of those discussions, when tiananmen comes up, he is of the view that the student revolt was essentially a carry on of Mao's crazy ideas of ""continuous revolution"", albeit a far less violent version of it compared to the Great Leap and earlier movements. He loved to point out (well, when he wasn't busy name dropping his PhD mentor from Yale) that current president Xi Jinping is of an age where he was in/around universities right at the time of Tiananmen square. Its important that, in the context of the course I was taking, Tiananmen was not a unique or localized event: students at nearly every university were protesting and marching.... The incident with the tank simply became iconic bit of that protest.

For those students there was a strong view that capitalism and communism are not inherent opposites. They were advocating still having the same sort of single party, communist state, but a capitalist economy where they could acquire better quality goods.

I mean, it may not be the RIGHT idea, and it may not even be the complete picture, but it is what I still recall of the course as being among the scholastic ideas being tossed around these days",

No personal anecdotes,"I'm not an historian, but I know American pop culture pretty well, especially the last 30 years.

The first time I heard of Ian McKellan was when he made the movie ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" which was released in 1993. That was a modestly successful movie but not huge and I don't think that McKellan really became known in the US at all even after that film. And that was 5 years after he came out in 1988, and if you look at his IMDB page, you'll see that he really didn't do much in the way of popular American films before that.

Without knowing for certain, my sense is that American audiences simply didn't know Ian McKellan barely at all, and I feel somewhat confident in saying that this news would have basically not made big news in the US if it made any news at all. So I would think an important point here would just be to note that even though he's really famous today, that this was not the case 30 years ago in the US context.

I highly recommend Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond as a primer - there are some legitimate critiques, but it's a really helpful starting point to understand how the world's power distribution got started and developed. Essentially, it has a lot to do with both geography and access to domesticable animals, as well as the size of a culture's population and the number of competitors, both of which highly influence exposure to diseases over time. Eurasia has the largest continuously passable landmass and has the most domesticable animals, both of which gave Western Europe enormous advantages as colonizers.

Okay,"Tales of drinking tea in Canada date back to Jacques Cartier's second voyage to North America. In 1535 he wintered on the St Lawrence River and when he and his men started getting sick from scurvy the Huron taught Cartier and his men to boil spruce needles and drink the tea to cure themselves.

Further west were tribes who's names were derived from using stones to cook their food and to boil soups and teas. The name Assiniboine literally translates to Stone Cree and until recently the natives living just east of the Rockies were collectively called Stoney Indians. West of the Rockies the Beaver and Sekahni Indians drank a soup made from the fleshy inner bark stripped from pine and spruce trees during times of starvation during long winter months and every tribe between the great lakes and Coastal Mountains has tales of boiling their moccasins or leather clothes to make a soup during hungry times during the long winter months.

In Northern and North Central British Columbia the natives used teas for a variety of medicinal purposes. . The stalks of devil's club was boiled and drank to alleviate the aches from arthritis. Bark from poplar trees was boiled into a tea and drank cold for a deworming medicine. Willow leaves were steeped in hot water which released a natural form of aspirin to releave general aches and pains. The flower of the yarrow plant was boiled and then the flower was bound over an infected wound to draw out the poison. This was also used with some success as a method of curing blood poisoning. The natives living in the far Northern regions of British Columbia and Southern Yukon Territory boiled a mixture of Cariboo Grass and Balsam Bark and drank this to cure cancer. Natives living in Northern Ontario also made a tea of various roots and leaves which they used to cure cancer. This concoction contained some plants that were brought to North America by European immigrants so this implies that the Indians were trying new Plants and making new recipes as time progressed. For non medicinal purposes as well as to prevent scurvy they made teas from spruce needles and also from Rose Hips. Blueberry leaves were drank as a tea for no other reason but because it tasted well. The Beaver Indians also dug up a root which they boiled, added sugar to then let ferment into a weak alcoholic beverage. I remember drinking some that was made by my dads employees back when I was a child and thinking it was a putrid concoction. They showed me what plant it was but as I was only about 11 years old I wasn't paying enough attention to remember what they showed me.

There are many other plants that the North American natives used for making teas from, both for medicinal and recreational purposes. The types and uses varied from region to region. There is a fungus called Chaga that grows on birch and poplar trees. The one that grows on birch has been receiving much attention today with a tea made from it being claimed to be a cure all for diabetes, high blood pressure, psoriasis and a number of other ailments. This tea has been investigated by some labs which find there is some merit to these claims. The use of Chaga as a medicine originated from Siberia and has no history here in North America that I have been able to find. Though it was not used as a medicine here the fungus was commonly used by the natives here. The fungus has a hard Woody crust and a soft pulpy inside. The soft internals of the chaga is moist and slowly smoulders so the Beaver and Sekahni Indians would use it as a method of carrying fire with them on their travels. A large piece of chaga can smoulder for up to two days and when they wanted to light a fire they would just hold some tinder against it and blow on it until the tinder caught on fire.

Each tribe took advantage of what materials were most abundant to them when making their cooking vessels. The plains Indians used buffalo hides. Those from Northern British Columbia made water proof baskets from spruce bark ( I have a friend who is in her early 90's who still makes these). Natives from central and coastal Southern British Columbia wove water tight baskets from cedar bark. The Chinook and Coastal Indians built boxes from split cedar which they used to cook soups in. The water in almost all of these pouches, baskets and boxes was heated by placing rocks heated in a fire inside them. They could also boil water in leather pouches by placing them directly over the fire.... but the pouch had to be soaked first and the fire could not reach higher than the level of the water or the hide would burn.

This works on the same principle as the old bar trick where you tell somebody you would give them a twenty, fifty or hundred dollar bill if they can burn a hole through it with a lit cigarette while holding it tight to their arm. It is almost impossible to do because the bill will not burn until the skin beneath it has been scorched burnt away from the arm. I say almost impossible to do because I had a roommate back in college who was in a bad accident and lost all feeling in his left arm. When he was broke and wanted to go on a bender he accepted this challenge for a hundred dollar bill and won them another person didn't believe it and made the same bet and lost as well.

Okay,"The best I can say is that both emerged in a similar political landscape that desired rejuvenation and resistance, favouring majority empowerment. But they were quite different in essence, and it would be like dubbing the French Revolutionaries ""Communist"" just because some of their ideas aligned.

Let's first consider origins. The Boxers began as a religious sect that branched out into militia activity to engage the wider populace by defending their interests. This was nothing new, with many unorthodox sects having done so in the past(The Three Kingdoms Period began with one such movement, while the real life White Lotus Sect helped found the Ming Dynasty). They slowly gained a following with the populace unhappy with foreign exploitation and communal tensions. Thus they began as a religious group that leveraged on local communities. The KMT on the other hand began as an overtly political organisation uniting several republican groups that already existed. They actively sought ways to engineer the political upheaval at home that would bring them to power. They tapped their Japanese patrons and diaspora co-conspirators in order to gain the resources needed for such an endeavour. Thus while the Boxers were a grassroots movement arising spontaneously in response to communal sentiment, the KMT were a dedicated political organisation even outside China focused on the end-goal of revolution.

This leads into consideration of their political aims. For all their wrath, the Boxers didn't have a cohesive political manifesto. All they really aimed for was the expulsion of foreign influence, but they didn't really have any idea of setting up some government after at beyond a general sense that officials should be hard-line. In fact, many of the leaders accepted that China would simply default back to the idealised model of centralised imperial rule backed by an extensive bureaucracy. Correspondingly, they subscribed.to a pre-modern notion of statehood where power was based on how far a central administration could cast its power, thus boundaries were loose and fluid. Legitimacy was vested personally and absolutely through the Mandate of Heaven though there were still means of social advancement (though the imperial examination isn't as great as many believe. Then as now, a competitive and difficult assessment often favoured those with financial means for quality education). They favoured a restoration of a hierarchical model where control radiated down from the top. The KMT in contrast didn't want to refurbish the system, they wanted to replace it. They were influenced by western political ideas, including sovereignty of the nation-state and power to the people. The organisation itself was modelled after revolutionary political parties in the West, with political mobilisation in mind. For the KMT , the Qing dynasty were an elite minority forcibly subjugating the majority, which paralleled the Ancien Regime of France. They were corrupt, tyrannical conquerors that needed to be removed for the benefit of the people. To save China from foreign exploitation they wanted to create a modern nation-state, one that could gain legitimacy just by being the state for the Chinese people, and could better mobilise resources to extend control over peripheral areas. With sovereign inviolable borders instead of loosely defined imperial spheres of influence, the KMT hoped to further stall any attempts at territorial acquisition at their expense. For all these reasons the imperial system itself was held to be harmful, inadequate and moribund, especially with the Qing repeatedly capitulating to foreign demands. Thus whereas the Boxers wanted to restore the perceived status quo of strong imperial rule, the KMT wanted to replace it with a nation-state model.

Consequently, the factions were treated very differently by the Qing. Obviously an organisation trying to destroy the system was incompatible, so the KMT were greatly repressed and were often forced to operate overseas, among the emigres who had left because of systematic disadvantages wrought by the imperial system. The Boxers didn't really want to get rid of the Qing, so were much less of a threat. In fact there were many amongst the imperial government who sympathised with the idea of anti-foreign resistance. A strong response was seen as the only way to eradicate the foreign occupiers and return the empire to its former glory. Even empress dowager Cixi felt sympathy for the goal of regaining what was lost through a show of force. Thus in the early days of the rebellion there was significant imperial support for the movement, especially from the hardliner faction led by Prince Duan. The imperial support provided more legitimacy for the movement and allowed it to swell. It was only after the violence destabilised administration and led to Western intervention that the government chose to dissociate itself and suppress the movement. Thus the organisations were treated very differently by the government.",What are some similarities and differences between the boxers and the kmt?

Depth,"Not all are, and probably most of todays' aren't (e.g. look at the extreme wing of the Alt-Right, the folks literally carrying swastika flags to political rallies, they're more dressed in either ""manual labor worker"" or ""buttoned-shirt 1950s family"" American clothing, rather than skinhead attire.)

But you're right that in the popular mind for several decades, before the Neo-Neo-Nazis galvanized, saying ""Neo-Nazi"" was almost synonymous with that stereotypical rough skinhead look, the one that would make the OG Nazis (that were super prissy about formal appearance and decorum) spin in their graves.

That particular style has originated in underground venues and circles of 1970s-80s Britain. It started as a general counter-culture movement, associated with various underground music genres and alternative lifestyles (similarly to how later other styles emerged, such as punk or goth.) And many skinheads never went past that (in fact, some became outspoken anti-Nazis, angry about their look being appropriated.) But underground counterculture movements are often breeding grounds for the angry and discontent (not to mention, predominantly young adult males eager to get in some trouble), and some offshoot into more extremist ideologies.

Beyond Britain, other Neo-Nazis just started copying that look, both because Nazis love copying shit (e.g. the Swastika from the Hindus), because it was well-known, and because in the days before the modern Alt-Right movement, there wasn't a ""mainstream"" Western way to express their ideology, so keeping that ""underground skinhead"" look was something they did on purpose, to signal they aren't part of the society which rejected them. In some countries like Germany, where openly being a Nazi is illegal, it was also a balance between making it obvious who you are to anyone who may be concerned, yet give plausible deniability against government interference (I mean, you can't arrest someone just because they look like a skinhead, right?)

Whereas today, the Neo-Neo-Nazis are switching up their look again, not only because they have a different (predominantly traditionalist/nativist-angled) imagery and talking points related to the currently waged kulturkampf we all know and love, but also because every average Joe sees it socially acceptable to shave their head (to hide pattern baldness, to avoid needing haircuts, or just as a mainstream fashion style), which makes it totally lose its appeal for those trying to look rebellious, or its value as a dogwhistle.

tl;dr: The skinhead Neo-Nazis didn't start as Neo-Nazis and then decide to became skinheads. They started as skinheads, and then some of those decided to become Neo-Nazis.

Okay,"I grew up in the British education system and am now a grad student at a program here in the States, and my field is colonial South Asia with a broader focus on British imperialism, so I may be able to offer some insight. I apologize if this response is not up this subs usual standards. However this is a very abstract question (I don't mean that in a negative way btw, it is also a very interesting one) that is difficult to quantify. It's kind of difficult to prove or disprove a statement of negation like the one Higgins made. It not like the academy has a running tally of ""articles that critique imperialism as a ratio to total articles published."" But anyway, I will do my best to try and give some insight.

1) Is there a feigned amnesia in the US academy over British/European imperialism? I would argue a very strong no

The best way to quantify this would be to look at the rankings for the top history programs in the US. Take the top 30 universities as a sample size and go through their faculty lists. You will find an enormous wealth of current historians working directly on British, European, and American imperialism, and at the top 10-15 universities in particular, will find a wealth of historians who have published works that pretty strongly critique imperial rule. As CapriciousCupofTea has already pointed out, empire and colonialism is absolutely having a heyday in the American Academy. Look at any undergraduate course list for the top 40 universities in the States and you will see an almost endless amount of courses on European/American imperialism. To say there is a ""disinclination in both academic and journalistic account to critique empire"" is quite off the mark as far the American academy is concerned. Now, I know Higgins's qualm is with European academies, my point here is that it is important to note where studies of imperialism are flourishing.

2) What about the British academy? It's harder to say. I get where Higgins is coming from, but he’s not quite right if you take his quote literally

(I will stick here to the British academy and British imperialism since that is my field).

Certainly, in my experience of studying colonial South Asia the ""softer"" critiques of colonial rule do indeed, largely, come out of the British academy. In the field of South Asian history in particular there were huge debates in the 80s and 90s reaching across the Atlantic where American scholars of South Asia, many of whom had studied at Chicago/Columbia, looked at the works of British historians from the Cambridge/Oxford schools as somewhat subconsciously downplaying the effects of Colonial rule. These critiques were not unreasonable considering that up to the 1980s the British academy was indeed still heavily influenced by scholars with either immediate, or single generation ties to the Raj. Take for instance, any one of John Keay's works. Now Keay is a good historian, and he writes very well, but British rule is largely characterized as a mostly peaceful one punctuated by the admittedly awful atrocity here and there. It's history that is sort of ""well there was good and bad."" But major episodes of British mismanagement during colonial rule, such as the Bengal Famine, are almost entirely non-existent in works likes Keay's ""India: A History.""

We still see this somewhat in historians working through an Oxford/Cambridge historiographic lens today. Just to take a few examples, Tirthankar Roy works on South Asian economics during colonial rule and can definitely be charged with underplaying numerous aspects of the oppressive nature of colonial rule (particularly concerning India's rural economy). Even more popular historians like Yasmin Khan and William Dalrymple can perhaps be charged with downplaying the extractive and destabilizing nature of colonial rule. In Khan's ""Great Partition"" for instance - one of the rare academic works that broke through into popular culture - there is definitely a sense that she foregrounds Partition as a game of politics that was shared evenly between the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Raj. The book is impressive, but the analysis and the placing of all three political rivals on the same level of power dynamics is a bit misguided since it is unquestionable the British were the supreme ruling power until 1947. So Higgins's argument could be applied here. That is, in the British academy, British colonial rule is indeed focused on, but biting critiques of colonial rule tend not to be found as they would coming from scholars working in America or India.

Even Dalrymple, the biggest name in terms of popular history working on colonial India, could have the argument that he presents colonial history as something of a mostly peaceful rule punctuated by atrocities here and there leveled at him (I could expand on Dalrymple at length if necessary). However, the point here, ultimately, is that it is difficult to agree with Higgins and say the topic of imperialism is simply shied away from in British academia, but you can indeed argue that those in British academia have much softer critiques of imperialism than they perhaps should. So I kind of get what Higgins is trying to say.

3) In the wider British public is there a feigned amnesia? Probably yes but also it's more complicated than that

The British government since the period of decolonization has not really, to any substantial degree, ever really acknowledged the toll colonial rule took on their colonies. Otherwise you wouldn't get the shock over works like Caroline Elkins's ""Imperial Reckoning"" - about the concentration camps in Kenya in the 50s - which when it came it in 2006 was met with almost a shock horror from many on the fringes of the British academy (to my understanding anyway). Nor would you get things like Shashi Tharoor's 2015 Oxford Union speech about how Britain owes India reparations of £1 per year (a powerful symbolic gesture) going viral. Historians like Niall Ferguson, who unquestionably celebrates (to a degree) the virtues of colonialism, still dominate much public discourse on colonial rule. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread things like the infamous PragerU video on British colonialism - which is basically straight up celebrating the civilizing mission of colonial rule - have a huge effect on wider discourse particularly in the States but also worldwide.

Additionally, in Britain a survey from 2015 showed 59% of Britons polled felt the empire was something to be proud of, whilst a more recent poll showed a plurality of Britons thought the empire made life in their former colonies better and a quarter wished Britain still had their empire (although 50% said they did not wish Britain still had their empire). Now these surveys are naturally pretty flawed and the questions asked are remarkably loaded, but you could argue they give somewhat of an overview of British cultural feeling toward the empire. Although it is important to note that the younger demographics have much stronger anti-empire opinions, which is perhaps representative of a current cultural demographic shift on this point.

In summary - what I would respond to Higgins's point is 1) I know he doesn't say the academy in US shies away from critiquing empire, but it is still important to note that in the US academy studies of imperialism are flourishing, and in my view, generally include very nuanced critiques. 2) He kinda has a point about the British academy, and you could definitely argue the British academy, to a certain degree, does not acknowledge their own imperial bias, but to say the British academy on the whole shies away from critiquing their imperial past is not really true. Although you could definitely argue those critiques are not particularly strong and as such contribute to this idea of ""feigned amnesia"". 3) Higgins has more of a point about the non-academic world of the general public in Britain, although one must note that large sections of the general public definitely does not have a ""feigned amnesia"" even if you could fairly argue that even larger portions of the public probably do.",Is there a 'feigned amnesia' over British and European Imperialism in academia?

Depth,"Aryan was a sort of an umbrella term. Old racial eugenicist “science” (pseudoscience, not real science) is confusing and inconsistent but generally “Aryans” (Europeans) were divided into subcategories. The “Nordic race,” also called Teutonic, was believed to be the purest of the Aryans. There was the “Alpine race” and the “Mediterranean race.” There were sometimes more categories, such as the “Dinaric race” and “east Baltic race.” Hitler actually was considered/speculated to have a mixture of Nordic and Dinaric (and sometimes also Alpine) blood. It was acknowledged by the Nazis that most Germans weren’t pure Nordic and mostly a mixture of various types. The “Alpine race” was believed to be common in Central Europe, including southern Germany and Austria. Mussolini also was considered to be of the “Alpine race.”

Nordic blood was believed to be the best Aryan blood, and the Nazis wanted to increase the amount of Nordic blood in future generations, but they still believed the other subcategories of the “Aryan race” were superior to non-Aryan peoples.

Sources,"The convex shape of the aspis and slight ""lip"" around the rim allowed the Classical hoplitai to rest the shield upon the pauldron/shoulder while maintaining a grip on the shield utilizing its interior strap (which was innovated at two important intervals, the dates of which I cannot recall at the moment, but will expand upon later). which was a Carian innovation stemming from the mid-8th century BCE.

In doing so, the shield would cover the upper body of the hoplite, as well as the partially exposed spear-arm of the compatriot to their left in the classical hoplite phalanx. It should be noted, as well, that this shield (known as the Argive shield) (the name of which - I am leaning towards Argive - I am also blanking upon, but will correct later on) was an improvement made in the Peloponnese (not by the Spartans, either!)before the dawn of the Greek Golden Age. is an innovation attributed to the city-state of Argos.

It is a marked improvement over the Boeotian or Thracian - or even pelta that lends its name to the peltastai or skirmishing forces of ancient Greece - shields that would commonly be utilized by early Greek spearmen, and was first seen in use by Dorian tribes in the Peloponnese nearing the end of the Greek Dark Age.

The classical hoplite that is so well known to us, and most often portrayed - large, rounded bronze shield, bronze cuirass, greaves, and plumed helm - was really the Greek innovation on a Mesopotamian idea. The wonderous bronze cuirass being a Euboan design from the 8th century BCE, and that most famous helm being of Corinthian design, emerging at roughly the same time as the Argive shield: early 7th century BCE.

The above stated, back to the actual use of the shield!

Once the phalanx had been formed by both armies, the hoplites would march toward one another, spears bristling and shields snuggly tucked onto their shoulders, until they had reached the point of impact. The last few metres between the opposing phalanxes would often be marked by an increase in the speed of the combatants, as they hurl themselves forward behind their shield, grieves, and helm - a Greek encased in bronze, Hades-bent on rolling over the opponent! - and pull a manuever of smashing their shield into the line of the opposing phalanx. The weight behind such a heavily armoured soldier would be difficult to withstand, individually, but the phalanxes often stood at roughly 8 shields deep (and one should note that the Greeks would discuss how 'deep' their formation was by way of shields).

The frontmen would meet, smashing into one another, and the men behind them would press their shoulders deeper into their own shields, each rank pressing against the back of the man ahead of him, to leverage their weight against that of the enemy phalanx. This force, called osthimos (meaning massive push or forward momentum), was what gave the shield its advantage over the others.

Previous shields lacked the construction to allow the hoplite to put their full weight into the press forward, which resulted in less sturdy formations. By allowing the hoplite to focus all their energies and force forward, the Argive (again, I will correct once I review my sources later) gave the phalanx a new depth of power.

"No partial answers or ""placeholders","Shields would have been ubiquitous in all medieval armies, at all levels. The only time when they start to become less important is around the late 1500s, when firearms are beginning to shift the nature of warfare towards ranged combat and full suits of advanced plate armour make it obsolete for heavy cavalry.

At the simplest level, a shield is piece of material between you and a projectile. Without it, even the simplest ranged weapon (say, a sling) could kill you. It goes without saying that it protected from melee weapons too, and it could be used with very little training and benefitted from a rather low price, affordable by many combatants.
Within the logic of armies where most of the infantry is rather poor and untrained, a shield is a convenient substitute for body armour. This shield
from the Gokstad burial (around 900 AD) is roughly 56 cm in diamater, most likely similar to those used before in Carolingian times and later, until the end of the century when we see the emergence of the so called ""kite shield"" as shown by the Bayeaux Tapestry

. These shields, as far as reconstructive archaeology and reenactment tell us, are more than capable of defending the body from blows and projectiles.
Even in later times, as this hypothesis of drawing of the Battle of Campaldino (1289), provide us data to show us so.

Even knights and mounted fighters would employ shields, although there is a tendency for shields to shrink in size as armour keeps advancing, as shown in this XV century miniature

of the Battle of Crécy (1346), where knights are depicted as they would have during the 1400s and not the time of battle. In any case, they are fully enclosed in plate armour and discarding the shield. Plus, the most basic tactic a unit can perform, even if it's composed of fighters with little training, is to close ranks behind a line of shields (without even mentioning purpose formations of heavy infantry with shields, suck the Roman testudo and Greek hoplite phalanx).

In order to get past a shield, I will write a dedicated answer under this one and explain it properly.",
No No plagiarism,"The first combat use of the Tiger II was by the 1st Company of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion (s.H.Pz.Abt. 503) during the Battle of Normandy, opposing Operation Atlantic between Troarn and Demouville on 18 July 1944. Two were lost in combat, while the company commander's tank became irrecoverably trapped after falling into a bomb crater created during Operation Goodwood.

On the Eastern Front, it was first used on 12 August 1944 by the 501st Heavy Panzer Battalion (s.H.Pz.Abt. 501) resisting the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive. It attacked the Soviet bridgehead over the Vistula River near Baranów Sandomierski. On the road to Oględów, three Tiger IIs were destroyed in an ambush by a few T-34-85s.

Because these German tanks suffered ammunition explosions, which caused many crew fatalities, main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be stowed within the turret, reducing capacity to 68.[36] Up to fourteen Tiger IIs of the 501st were destroyed or captured in the area between 11 and 14 August to ambushes and flank attacks by Soviet T-34-85 and IS-2 tanks, and ISU-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain.

The capture of three operational King Tigers allowed the Soviets to conduct tests at Kubinka and to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

The Tiger II was also used in significant numbers, distributed into four heavy panzer battalions, during the Ardennes Offensive (also known as the Battle of the Bulge) of December 1944. At least 150 Tiger IIs were present, nearly a third of total production, and most were lost during the course of the offensive.

So, yes they were used immediatly after the US/UK landing on Omaha Beach, and later that year during the Ardennes Offensive. But as most of the german ""Super weapons"", ( Tiger II, Messchermits, V2 rockets, STG-44 and much more) arrived when the war was alredy lost.",

On 27 November 1950, the Chinese force surprised the US X Corps commanded by Major General Edward Almond at the Chosin Reservoir area. A brutal 17-day battle in freezing weather soon followed. Between 27 November and 13 December, 30,000 United Nations Command troops (later nicknamed ""The Chosin Few"") under the field command of Major General Oliver P. Smith were encircled and attacked by about 120,000 Chinese troops under the command of Song Shilun, who had been ordered by Mao Zedong to destroy the UN forces. The UN forces were nevertheless able to break out of the encirclement and to make a fighting withdrawal to the port of Hungnam, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. The retreat of the US Eighth Army from northwest Korea in the aftermath of the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River and the evacuation of the X Corps from the port of Hungnam in northeast Korea marked the complete withdrawal of UN troops from North Korea.

Okay,"In 1965, a student at the Kansas State Teachers College tried to identify, statement by statement, all the sources used by Ronald Reagan in the ""Time for choosing speech"" (Hayes, 1965). This was not strictly a ""debunking"" exercise: Hayes stated whether there was a source or not for each of the 35 assertions, checked the source to see if it matched Reagan's version (sometimes it did, sometimes it did not, and he asked Reagan for confirmation), but he did not investigate the truthfulness of the sources. Statement 27 to 30, which list some ""peculiar uses of US foreign aid funds"", can be traced back to an article published in the National Review on 20 March 1963 and written by Congressman Otto E. Passman, a strong opponent of foreign aid. The exact Passman quote was:

    One thousand 23-in TV sets were ordered for use in community education programs in underdeveloped countries at a cost of $400,000 for areas with no electric power supply

Note how the ""for use community education programs"" is missing from Reagan's speech, which gives the impression that those TVs were just given to foreigners for no particular reason.

Now, where did Passman find this information? This gets tricky. In 1961, Kennedy had pledged that the US would ""pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, [and] support any friend"". This included military support as well as soft power in the form of foreign aid. In 1963, he planned to request a $4.9 billion foreign aid package and created a committee, helmed by General Lucius Clay, to ""review the management, aims, and resources of America’s aid programme"" (David and Holm, 2016). The Committee, whose grandiose official title was ""Committee to Strengthen the Security of the Free World"" published in March 1963 a report (the Clay report) that was perceived at the time as harshly critical of US foreign aid, and helped Congress to slash the proposed budget down to $3.6 billion.

Among the arguments advanced by opponents like Passman, both in articles and during debates at the House, were such lists of bizarre examples meant to prove that US money was being wasted, the ""1000 TV sets"" among them. However, the Clay report does not mention any of this!

A Dallas right-wing newsletter called Life Lines, in an issue published in August 1963, also includes a similar list but with a different twist:

    $343 thousand for education television in Nigeria, though there are only two TV stations and very few TV sets in the country.

This is getting close. Indeed, the US at that time was big on what was called ""educational TV"" (ETV), seen as a smooth technological solution for educational problems. Several contemporary studies (Dizard, 1966; Gueulett, 1972) and reports (UNESCO, 1967) do indicate that the US, through USAID, the Peace Corps, and private organizations (such as the Ford Foundation) did pour money in developing countries, notably Nigeria and Colombia, to promote ETV by sending technical personel and equipment. While it is difficult to reconcile the figures given in 1963 by Passman (and Reagan) with those provided in those documents, the general conclusions for Nigeria were not really positive and did point at the inefficiency of the ETV-related aid brought to that country. The Western Region programme, started in 1959, was still struggling after 6 years, and was plagued by numerous issues, such as poor coverage, lack of staff, receiver breakdowns (maintenance was inexistent), and, indeed, power failures or fluctuating electrical current. 189 TVs sets had been obtained by the programme, with 25 paid by US AID to replace broken ones. In Northern Nigeria, US AID had started a programme in 1962 (there were actually two programmes overlapping in 1964). There were 41 TVs installed in schools with a further 27 unused or broken. The region's geographic isolation resulted in many TV sets (sometimes half of them!) being damaged in transit. The UNESCO report concluded:

    While the vastness of the region's area and its low population means that a relatively small proportion of the schools are within the reception zone of the two television transmitters, lack of electrical connexions reduces the number of participating schools even in the reception zone. This imposes a serious restriction on the potential student-output for the programme.

The UNESCO report found that the programme was too costly given its poor results - few participating schools, little actual instruction time.

We cannot be sure that the preliminary reports on the Nigerian ETV aid programmes were the source used by Passman, but the UNESCO report of 1967 shows the same concern about high-tech education being useless where electricity is not reliable or does not exist. Of course, Passman and Reagan's facile quips focus on the number (1000, a round number) and the size (23 inches! but this was due to the fact that the TVs had to be large enough for classrooms) of the TVs rather than on the money spent on salaries and facilities, but they were not completely wrong.

No plagiarism,"Worth noting is that Walt Disney himself campaigned for James Baskett to win an Academy Award for his performance as Uncle Remus. Walt Disney wrote a personal letter on January 30, 1948, to Jean Hersholt, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, suggesting that James Baskett be awarded a special Academy Award for his work as Uncle Remus in Song of the South.

According to Walt’s letter, Baskett had not only brought to life the ""immortal folklore character"" of Uncle Remus, but that Baskett’s performance was his own creation, “almost wholly without direction.”

Disney was not alone in his praise of Baskett’s performance. Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper was one of the many journalists who declared that he should receive an Academy Award for his work as well.

Baskett was handed the honorary Oscar on March 20, 1948, for ""his able and heartwarming characterization of Uncle Remus, friend and storyteller to the children of the world"" by actress Ingrid Bergman. He was the first African-American male to receive an Academy Award. Baskett tragically died of heart problems and complications from diabetes just months later on September 9, 1948, at age 44.

Okay,"A controversial question, not just politically but because it's typically hard to rigorously identify causal connections in an economy.

One part of this is easily answerable - manufacturing output has risen in the USA since 1987, according to all statistics, which is a continuation of longer-term trends. Unfortunately my google skills are failing to find the longer-term complete series, but back in 1986, the US's Bureau of Labour Statistics was already noting the shift to services in the economy since 1959, with total manufacturing output rising, while employment in manufacturing was holding steady.    According to the BLS, in 1959, manufacturing was 17m, in 1980 it was 21m, while services employment over the same period went from 41m to 72m.  BLS, Deindustrialisation and the shift to services, Table 1, page 5 of BLS report,  https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1986/06/art1full.pdf Confusingly, the St Louis Fred has a long-term graph of manufacturing employment from 1940 to today, which shows a bit less than 16m employees in 1960 and a bit less than 19m in 1980, but the same general pattern. There was a significant fall in manufacturing employment 2000-2010, but even then US manufacturing output was rising up until the 2008 global financial crisis, and it still is well above 1980s levels.

Basically US manufacturing has been getting much more automated, for decades. And observationally, this seems to be mainly the result of developments in areas like computers and information technology, which got started well before the 1980s. For example, the first transistor was invented in Bell Labs, New Jersey in 1947.

There are of course numerous other changes going on in any economy. For example, from the 1960s onwards there has been an expansion of regulations

aimed at protecting the environment and occupational health, along with numerous other regulations, little of which was unwound in the 1980s. It's hard to measure regulations objectively, but the US Federal Register (pdf) reports that between 1975 and 2000, the Code of Federal Regulations went from 69 thousand pages to 133 thousand. Therefore the extent to which there was actually deregulation of the US economy in aggregate is doubtful.

Then there's technological changes and social changes. I've already mentioned the invention of the transititor, other examples are the playing out of the Second Industrial Revolution

in the 1960s and 60s, with the building of inter-state highways and the expansion of air transport. Social changes include the growth in the US work force with at least a secondary education, the rise in labour market participation by women, and the growth in retirees as a share of the population with the growth in life expectancy (which arguably affects political outcomes, as the elderly tend to disproportionately vote).

Economists and economic historians have been trying to disentangle the impacts of all this for decades. Usefully, Elhanan Helpman, a professor at Harvard University, published a review article in 2016, which is available online. From the abstract:

    Building on this research, I conclude that trade played an appreciable role in increasing wage inequality, but that its cumulative effect has been modest, and that globalization does not explain the preponderance of the rise in wage inequality within countries.

One piece of evidence for this is that if trade was the main driver of what is happening in rich countries, then as low income countries opened up to trade we should see the opposite impact: in those countries we would see falling skilled workers' premiums. Yet lower income countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colomia, India and Mexico, who had drastic cuts in tariffs in the 1980s and early 1990s, saw a rising skilled workers premium during this time too.

Another piece is that the relative employment of skilled workes increased in all manufacturing industries in the USA, and similarly in other rich countries like Australia, Belgium and the UK.

There is evidence that the growth in trade have adversely affected some workers. Helpman notes for example:

    Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) found that imports from China had large differential employment effects across U.S. commuting zones, where employment declined more in zones whose industries were more exposed to import competition from China. (Page 39)

Helpman, Elhanan. 2017. “Globalization and Wage Inequality.” Journal of the British Academy 5: 125-162., Available online at  https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/helpman/files/globalization_and_wage_inequality_120216_final_for_wp.pdf

As for ""wealth becoming concentrated in a small number of financial or tech hub cities"", this animation of BEA data on GDP per capita by US state doesn't support that story. A bit more academically, but perhaps less interesting visually, the urban economist Edward Glaese, with Kristina Tobio, has noted The Rise of the Sunbelt as the income of southern states from 1950 to 2000 has converged towards the national average - along with housing prices.

This is a view of course that draws heavily on published statistics and some specialised economics research. I can't speak for what historians generally think, given that most historians specialise in different areas.

Okay,"Standard historian opening: nothing in history is inevitable. Things only look inevitable with the benefit of hindsight. Anyhoo! My answer below comes from my knowledge as Cold War historian, not a Soviet specialist. I hope that it goes some way towards answering your question. Regarding your query about George Kennan, I'm afraid you'll need to be more specific about which article you're referring to! He was a prolific writer and thinker, and produced a vast body of work.

The Cold War ended because of a) a group of reformers in the USSR; b) changes to Soviet policy (at home and abroad); c) and the efforts of millions of people in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Soviets finally abandoned the war in Afghanistan, released their grip on Eastern European 'satellite states', and allowed the independence of the Soviet republics. Senior Soviet officials (especially Mikhail Gorbachev) also made some pretty remarkable (in the context of what had gone before) concessions in terms of their attempts to halt (and potentially reverse) the nuclear arms race. The Cold War ended when it did and how it did because of series of events that brought into power a Soviet leader with a radically different mind-set, allied to the pre-existing demands for change that had sweeping through Eastern Europe for quite some time (indeed, it's possible to argue that these demands had always been there, but by the 1980s they were being voiced more fully and by a greater proportion of the population). The combination of reform from the top and 'revolution from below' (although to what extent events in Eastern Europe were 'revolutions from below' is something that needs to be analysed for each individual case, e.g.: the manifest differences between what happens in Poland and East Germany) were what brought the Cold War to a (largely) peaceful conclusion.

As détente staggered towards collapse in the mid to late 1970s, so too did the Soviet dream. Although the USSR still remained a superpower in terms of its nuclear arsenal and gigantic conventional forces, it lagged behind the USA in pretty much every other measure of military power. The USSR was also being seriously hampered by a number of internal factors:

    It was led by a group of ageing, sick old men, wedded to increasingly outdated Marxist-Leninist dogma. Leonid Brezhnev died in November 1982, to be succeed by former KGB chief Iiuri Andropov who died in February 1984, who was then succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko who died in March 1985. At the top, there was no innovation or desire for any kind of change to the increasingly untenable and unstable status quo.
    The Soviet economy was in a truly terrible state, as the military-industrial defence complex absorbed vast amount of capital and resources. Consumer goods were sparse, queues for food common, and it had become clear to millions of Soviet citizens that Moscow’s tales of how things were much worse in the west were nothing more than obfuscation at best, outright lies at worst.
    Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe were becoming increasingly restive, with demands for greater political, social, and cultural freedoms. And even further afield, Afghanistan was a running sore, consuming personnel and resources in the seemingly unwinnable war against the mujahedeen.

In the mid-1980s, some truly dramatic changes took place. The most important in terms of national leadership was the ascent of Mikhail Gorbachev to the top position in the Soviet Union. This was coupled to US president Ronald Reagan’s increasingly conciliatory language and actions, a radical departure from the confrontational tone of his first term in office.

It became clear to the Soviet politburo that they could not continue with the merry-go-round of leadership, with ill old men continually reaching the top and then dying in short order. On March 11, 1985, one day after Konstantin Chernenko's death, Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and leader of the USSR. Prior to to coming to power, Gorbachev had been identified by Western leaders – particularly the UK's Margaret Thatcher – as a high Soviet official that they could work with. Setting aside dogma, Gorbachev was willing to debate and discuss in good faith.

Importantly, Gorbachev came to power as a reformer, not a revolutionary. His reformist policies can be summed up in two words. Glasnost was his policy of openness, increased transparency with Soviet government, and a willingness to tolerate dissent and discussion. Perestroika was reform of the USSR’s politics and economy, but within a socialist system. This last bit is crucial, as it was not Gorbachev’s intention to turn the USSR into a capitalist state or to see it cease to exist. Most importantly of all, Gorbachev was keen to engage in constructive talks with the United States, and he found a willing partner in Reagan. Gorbachev offered concessions that were even more radical than outside observers could have predicted.

Moreover, his implicit and then explicit renunciation of the Brezhnev Doctrine (the Soviet right to militarily intervene if communist rule in satellite states was threatened), his willingness to allow domestic debate about reform, and his openness to new ways of thinking sent a powerful message that this was not the same old same old Soviet Union. Indeed, his inaction when it came to the changes that swept Eastern Europe in the late 1980s (end of communist rule in Poland, for example) said more than any amount of explicit statements and speeches.

What happened from the late 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall onwards was a series of events that cast a long shadow into the twenty-first century. Reagan’s successor George H W Bush agreed with his West German counterpart Helmut Kohl that a speedy push for German reunification was a wise move. Things moved with astonishing rapidity, with monetary, political, and military reunification being agreed in short order. With the 1990 reunification, the whole of Germany could finally be made part of the European project. With the Maastricht Treaty's conclusion in 1992, the European Community metamorphosed into the European Union, with a reunified Germany as a key component.

Perhaps even more dramatic than Germany's reunification was the USSR’s collapse. Gorbachev’s willingness to let the states of eastern Europe go their own way predictably (with a degree of hindsight!) led to the USSR's constituent republics demanding their right to self-determination. Weakened by economic decline and ever deeper political divisions at both the centre and the periphery of Soviet power, high officials in the Kremlin could do little to avoid this. What was remarkable about the USSR’s collapse is its speed and its (mostly) peaceful nature. First to go were the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. After a futile attempt to keep them on board, the Baltic states went their own way and achieved independence.

This led to significant domestic criticism of Gorbachev from harder-line communists who blamed him for ‘losing’ Eastern Europe and giving away what remained of Soviet power. After a failed hard-line coup in August 1991, Gorbachev just couldn't salvage the reformed Soviet regime or get any kind of agreement for a looser confederation. The Russian leader Boris Yeltsin and his allies – who had been instrumental in defeating the August coup – won out, and in November the CPSU was banned and in December, the USSR was superseded by the short-lived Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The nations that had made up the Soviet Union now went merrily on their own ways, to varying degrees. The Cold War was over, as one side simply ceased to exist.

In the end, what role did the high level leaderships in the USA and USSR play in bringing about the Cold War’s end? US presidents – Reagan and Bush – played an important, but crucially secondary role. Reagan became more conciliatory in his second term, but Gorbachev revolutionised the USSR’s foreign policy. George Bush supported the Soviet leader, but his generally cautious approach towards events in central and eastern Europe was overshadowed by Gorbachev’s manifest boldness. The changes to Soviet policy were of a greater magnitude – and were far more painful for the USSR as a whole – than were any changes to US policy. The Cold War ended when it did because of series of events that brought into power and Soviet leader with a radically different mind-set. Once in power, Gorbachev drew upon ideas that were perhaps not necessarily that radical in a broader, global sense but were fundamentally radical within the framework of what had gone before in the Soviet Union. These ideas permitted the inauguration of conceptual and systemic change on the domestic and international scenes. Coupled to the vocal desire for changes in Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and elsewhere, the Cold War’s end fundamentally came from the east, not from the west.

Hope this answers your question.

"No partial answers or ""placeholders","For a short answer, ""America"" (the 13 colonies represented by the american congress) [initallly offered the province of quebec to join them as an equal state in congress in october 1774](https://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2903018?docref=fDsPCF8kSj-nAKffr8lw2g). They however didn't receive a response from Québec and so resorted to war to remove the british from canada. Even if the war was directed against the british forces which were occupying the province of Québec, there was still some hostility from the 13 colonies towards the population of the province of quebec, mostly due to the fact that ""Canadians"" (french habitants of what is today known as Canada, most of them born there) were Catholics and ""Americans"" were protestant.

However, the most important part of your question is What was the goal of the Canadian campaign? The answer to this question can't be limited to the region of the province of Quebec and can't be limited to the military campaign either. The invasion of 1775 was in fact part of the larger movement known as the american revolution (i'm pretty sure i don't need to explain the reasons behind the american revolution, there is a LOT of scholar litterature about those and it should be easily available online) and so the war wasn't primarily directed against the population of quebec rather than the British crown and empire. It is important to note that numerous [French soldiers helped the americans in later campaign](https://doi.org/10.7202/801448ar) and that some canadians were in favour of it and fought for the amercian cause.

However, we musn't forget that one of the reasons that sparked the revolutiopn were the intolerable acts and that one of them was the Quebec act. The Quebec act can essentially be summed up in 5 points :

    the expansion of the province of quebec's territories over indian lands

    being a protestant was no longer necessary in the oath of allegiance which was necessary to be part of the administration of the state.

3.the catholic church would now be permitted to perceive the tithe once again

4.freedom of religion was now garanteed in the province of quebec (pretty much only affected catholics)

    french civil law was restored in the province of quebec

While pretty much all of those were seen badly by the population of the 13 colonies which were protestants, one of the biggest issues that qualified the quebec act as an intolerable act was the expansion of the provinces territory which essentially [enclaved the territory of other states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Act#/media/File:The_British_colonies_in_North_America.jpg

). This also meant that even with a total cooperation from the inhabitants of the province of quebec, more issues would've come up because of the territory changes that came with the 1774 quebec act.

Now for the rest of your question about an alternate reality where the amercians won, i'm not qualified to answer nor have i found any credible secondary sources about the subject so I won't go into the subject. However if you want to talk about it on a less official platform I'd be happy if you want to DM me about your theories.

This is a quick answer to the questions you asked and the deeper understanding of the relationship between quebec and the other british north amercian states could be more than a thesis subject so i'll try in the next days to add potential sources if you'd be interested to read more on the subject.

I'm a bit short on time for the weekend so i'll cite more secondary sources and expend my answer before monday evening (mods, you can feel free to remove my answer after that if i forget to change it but i'd like a bit more time before this gets deleted).

I hope that this answers the biggest parts of your question, don't hesitate to add more to your questions in reply to this comment if necessary.",

Okay,"Beating your servants in 17th c. France was not unusual, for cause. For a large household, servants were necessary. There would be constant temptation for them to steal small items, especially food, which could range from pocketing the spare apple to selling goods out the back door, and punishments for that were expected. But there was a real hierarchy in society that they'd be also expected to acknowledge, and stepping out of their place by venturing opinions, or becoming surly and disobedient, might be punishable. Like poor Master Jacques, the cook/coachman in Moliére's The Miser

    Har. And I would know from you, Master Jacques, what it is that is said of me.

    Jac. Yes, certainly, Sir, if I were sure you would not get angry with me.

    Har. No, no; never fear.

    Jac. Excuse me, but I am sure you will be angry.

    Har. No, on the contrary, you will oblige me. I should be glad to know what people say of me.

    Jac. Since you wish it, Sir, I will tell you frankly that you are the laughing-stock of everybody; that they taunt us everywhere by a thousand jokes on your account, and that nothing delights people more than to make sport of you, and to tell stories without end about your stinginess. One says that you have special almanacks printed, where you double the ember days and vigils, so that you may profit by the fasts to which you bind all your house; another, that you always have a ready-made quarrel for your servants at Christmas time or when they leave you, so that you may give them nothing. One tells a story how not long since you prosecuted a neighbour's cat because it had eaten up the remainder of a leg of mutton; another says that one night you were caught stealing your horses' oats, and that your coachman,—that is the man who was before me,—gave you, in the dark, a good sound drubbing, of which you said nothing. In short, what is the use of going on? We can go nowhere but we are sure to hear you pulled to pieces. You are the butt and jest and byword of everybody; and never does anyone mention you but under the names of miser, stingy, mean, niggardly fellow and usurer.

    Har. (beating Jacques). You are a fool, a rascal, a scoundrel, and an impertinent wretch.

    Jac. There, there! Did not I know how it would be? You would not believe me. I told you I should make you angry if I spoke the truth?

    Har. Learn how to speak.

Obviously, Master Jacques has not been stripped , tied up and given thirty lashes, only thwacked a few times with a cane (and notice how Harpagon is tasked for not giving his servants gifts at Christmas- there were certain expectations for the master and the upper classes to be handing out tips and doing favors, as well). But administering a beating to people who don't know their place was not just limited to servants. When the chevalier de Rohan-Chabot was insulted by Voltaire, in the mid 18th c., he had his servants really beat him up, much more than a few thwacks with a cane: and Voltaire discovered that the family had enough influence to not only keep him, a commoner, from seeking redress for the assault or challenging the chevalier to a duel, but to get him imprisoned in the Bastille when he tried.","In The Three Musketeers, D'Artagnan gives his valet a ""thrashing"" when he is disappointed by his performance. Was this a normal practice?"

No speculation,"nterestingly, recent analyses seem to suggest a relationship between the Romani and the Domba/Dom people of India, who similarly lead a transient lifestyle and are spread all across India. So in a way I think that answers your question.

Genetic study is still ambiguous, but what seems clear is that the founding population originated in Northwestern India, which is linguistically supported by uncanny resemblances to Kashmiri and Shina. There isn't a completely fixed date as to when this population started moving west, but it is generally considered to be between 600 and 1100 CE. Thus the Mahmud of Ghazni theory, while not implausible, is not conclusively proven(And even if it did occur in Mahmud's reign it's not certain that it was his military campaigns specifically that caused it).

I can't really offer a specific reason, but if I were to guess , it's likely to find areas with plentiful resources. From their vantage point in the northwest moving westwards would have been as tempting as moving East. They would likely have crossed towards Iran, where there had been prosperous regions bustling with cultural exchange. This is briefly hinted to in one passage of the Shahnameh, where a group of traveling musicians in India are forced to adopt a transient lifestyle as punishment. From there , they could either go south as the Domari would, or continue further west to other land. Note that as of recent studies the Dom community are believed to have immigrated prior to the Romani. Sure enough, we find in the Caucasus the Lom community, who practice similar cultural attributes to the Romani. As to why they did not press further north, I would suggest that perhaps the Caucasus mountains and the Pontic steppe were too daunting. Moving west they likely traversed Anatolia before moving into Europe, where the environment was less arid and more opportunities could be sought. Thus I think they simply continued moving as part of their transient culture, until they finally reached a place suitable for their needs. We see something similar in the nomadic migrations from Central Asia or even Siberia into Europe, through groups like the Magyar or Avars.",

No political agendas or moralising ,"Neonoirs such as Roman Polanski' s (IMO, way overrated) Chinatown features one of the best slap scenes in cinemas.

If you strictly talking about Film Noir era 1930s-1940s, I do not remember any film noir that make ""slapping"" as a rememorable scenes.

Those films often featured nasty, manupilative women and nihilistic anti-heroes so the protagonist slapping the femme fatale is not an unexpected occurence. ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"" are two of the most iconic and definitive film noirs. There are plenty of sexual innuendos in the former, and the later had a great villianess, so I would look for it. Even if you don' t find what you are looking for, enjoy two of the best film noirs ever made.

The statement that women are turned on by that violent is refered by a female character the 1950s, ""A Streetcar Called Desire"" starring the young Marlon Brando. Film historians/critics that aren' t too influenced by feminist theories already knew the truth of that statement when ""The Shiek"", silent film featuring sexual assault were extremely popular with female audience back in the 1920s. These are the days before widespread pornography. In that period, most directors, producers, screenwriters are men. The genre is star power and whatever sells. Had the Hays Code not happened, or there are more female directors in the period, you may had some concrete statements to back it up. The actresses are artists of their own and might be your best guesses of female fantasy in the eras.

If you want to know more, I suggested to look for Camille Paglia. She may be a half-nutcase outdated boomer but she is very erudite about film theories and very accepting of problematic themes in films. Something, most critics found it very hard to do. I really don' t know much about the ""Male Gaze"" or other feminist film critiques or history in fillmmaking. The early female filmmaker, one that I know of, in the time periods made only short surrealist art films. By the 1960s and the 1970s, the female directors I knew of, tend to either blend a lot of disturbing erotic elements into their films.",
No speculation,"The mansion that was the president's residence wasn't given any official name beyond the president's residence, and the original documents where they were asking for people to submit architectural drawings stated that they were for 'a residence to serve the president of these united states'.

It was called the President's House mainly, as well as President's Mansion. It was called the White House before it was burned because it was white in color. Choosing to call it white originally had nothing to do with any sort of white/black dynamic. It's not like it's 'house that belongs to a white person'...it's a house that is colored white. Just like George Washington's White Horse is called George Washington's White Horse because it is white in color not because it was ridden by a white man.

Any symbolic value in the white is not related to skin color but to the architecture found in ancient Greece, especially Athens - as the founders were inclined to see strong parallels between themselves and the people of Athens due to how Athens is seen to be an early democracy and part of the inspiration for the structure of the country. And also, white paint infused limestone powder was a good preservative. That's why white picket fences are white picket fences - because they needed to put a preservative on the wood. Barns are traditionally red because sometime later people realized they could make their own paint with linseed oil, milk, and lime powder, but it was a poor man's alternative, and it was orange from the linseed oil. But by putting powdered rust in it, you could make it red. However, houses having already established white as the 'correct' color for the house and yard, were still predominantly painted white even at slightly higher cost up until other options became available.

I don't think the people of 1801-1810 even referred to themselves as white people. They referred to themselves as Caucasians when they weren't referring to the home nation of their parents or grandparents. The term was around, but it just didn't get used much. And even then, both caucasian (and white) was used differently, it excluded italians, spanish, greeks, finns, jews, and the slavic peoples. There was absolutely a concept of whiteness, as a description of people from Northern Europe, so a person in 1801 filling out some sort of survey or census whose ancestors were from Germany, France, or England would know to check 'white' if that's the best option, but they really much more strongly identified with the nation/culture of their forefathers rather than belonging to some monolithic 'white' race.

I think if people were trying to give the President's Residence some sort of name that was related to the different ethnic groups, they would likely have named it Freeman's House or something along that line. Because it definitely wasn't the house of the Red Man, Yellow Man, or Black Man. But no, it wasn't called White House in opposition to those groups. Those groups were so marginalized that it wouldn't have even occurred to people to name it in opposition to them, or to symbolize the exclusion of them, any more than they were going to name it the Humans' House to show that it wasn't the dogs' house, cattle's' house or horses' house.",

Sources,"An assembly line requires interchangeable parts, and interchangeable parts can be made quickly and cheaply only with good machines that can turn out a steady stream of those identical parts. Technically, that's basically your answer: it depended on the machines that made interchangeable parts

possible:

    Interchangeability of parts was achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several machine tools, such as the slide rest lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts. Electrification allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating line shaft drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large-scale manufacturing possible.

Socially, assembly lines just required lots of people living near the big assembly buildings. That happened when factories made employment available to people willing to move to the city. You start building a plant, advertise that you'll need X people to work the lines by the certain date, and the people show up to apply for jobs.",
No plagiarism,"At 3:30AM a train pulled up to a town and the Nazis ran through town rounding up everyone asleep and forced them onto the cattle cars. There was a bucket in the middle to use as a latrine but no one was comfortable defecating in what became claustrophobic cattle cars with terrified people and screaming children and sick, elderly people.

The train started moving while the people were so packed together that nobody could sit down.

Despite the embarrassment, you would pee down your leg and were “happy” for the relief and the warmth. And then the smells became unbearable. And the crying. And the fear.

Eventually, the train came to a holding area double surrounded by barbed wire. Angry German Shepherds would attack random people to ensure they knew the rules. A few attractive girls were dragged behind a small barricade and raped repeatedly. At first, the families could hear their daughters screaming for help, then whimpering, then silence and occasional grunting.

After two days of waiting and starving, a new train came to pick up the exhausted and famished Jews. Again they were crammed into cattle cars and again there was a mix of screams and the smell of terror and body odor.

The train arrived at a Concentration Camp in Poland after a few days.

Everyone had their gold fillings yanked from their mouths without anesthesia.

As Jewish were brought into the camp via train, they underwent a selection on the ramp. Those deemed unfit for work were sent directly to the gas chambers. However, the Nazis kept this a secret and told the unsuspecting victims that they had to undress for a bath.

Led to a well-camouflaged gas chamber with fake shower heads, the prisoners were trapped inside when a large door was sealed behind them. Then, an orderly, who wore a mask, opened a vent on the roof of the gas chamber and poured Zyklon B pellets down the shaft. He then closed the vent to seal the gas chamber.

The Zyklon B pellets turned immediately into a deadly gas. In a panic and gasping for air, prisoners would push, shove, and climb over each other to reach the door. But there was no way out. Within five to 20 minutes (depending on the weather), all inside were dead from suffocation.

Those that survived the selection were either sent to slave labor camps where they would sleep three men side by side on a tiny extension of concrete slab protruding from the wall or they were sent to a female concentration camp where they could be chosen to be sent to “Joy Divisions.”

A Joy Division was a sex slave brothel where the Jewish women could be raped by Nazi soldiers that “earned” the privilege for good behavior. Many times, the Joy Divisions were held in synagogues where the Jews had long since been taken away.

In the slave labor camps where the men worked, they would wake up, have a tiny bowl of water that was called soup and then they would go build things for the Germans. The guards at the slave camps were cruel and were not reprimanded for shooting a Jew with their pistol for any reason at all. The Judenrats were Jews whose job it was to ensure that any community leader from the “old country”, typically a rabbi, was murdered in front of the camp to discourage heroic acts. Heroism wasn’t easy because the men were starving, denied medical treatment, and were broken from the loss and murder of their families and friends.",
No plagiarism,"Despite common belief this was a dark joke, it seems it was at least initially used in a genuine sense (see bolder quote).

origin of expression:

The expression comes from the title of an 1873 novel by German philologist Lorenz Diefenbach, Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach, in which gamblers and fraudsters find the path to virtue through labour. The phrase was also used in French (le travail rend libre!) by Auguste Forel, a Swiss entomologist, neuroanatomist and psychiatrist, in his Fourmis de la Suisse (English: ""Ants of Switzerland"") (1920). In 1922, the Deutsche Schulverein of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist ""protective"" organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase Arbeit macht frei.

use by Nazis

Dachau The slogan Arbeit macht frei was placed at the entrances to a number of Nazi concentration camps. The slogan's use was implemented by SS officer Theodor Eicke at Dachau concentration camp and then copied by Rudolf Höss at Auschwitz.

The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to Auschwitz I where the sign was erected by order of commandant Rudolf Höss. The Auschwitz I sign was made by prisoner-labourers including master blacksmith Jan Liwacz, and features an upside-down B, which has been interpreted as an act of defiance by the prisoners who made it.

In 1933 the first political prisoners were being rounded up for an indefinite period without charges. They were held in a number of places in Germany. The slogan was first used over the gate of a ""wild camp"" in the city of Oranienburg, which was set up in an abandoned brewery in March 1933.

It can also be seen at the Dachau, Gross-Rosen, and Theresienstadt camps, as well as at Fort Breendonk in Belgium. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over the entrance gates of the Monowitz camp (also known as Auschwitz III). The slogan appeared at the Flossenbürg camp on the left gate post at the camp entry. The original gate posts survive in another part of the camp, but the slogan sign no longer exists. Primo Levi describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) at Monowitz.

In 1938 the Austrian political cabaret writer Jura Soyfer and the composer Herbert Zipper, while prisoners at Dachau Concentration Camp, wrote the Dachaulied, or The Dachau Song. They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily forced labour, and considered the motto Arbeit macht frei over the gate an insult. The song repeats the phrase cynically as a ""lesson"" taught by Dachau.

In The Kingdom of Auschwitz, Otto Friedrich wrote about Rudolf Höss, regarding his decision to display the motto so prominently at the Auschwitz entrance:

    He seems not to have intended it as a mockery, nor even to have intended it literally, as a false promise that those who worked to exhaustion would eventually be released, but rather as a kind of mystical declaration that self-sacrifice in the form of endless labour does in itself bring a kind of spiritual freedom.

The signs are prominently displayed, and were seen by all prisoners and staff—all of whom knew, suspected, or quickly learned that prisoners confined there would likely only be freed by death. The signs' psychological impact was tremendous.",
Depth,"Germany had been accruing military power through the entire 19th century, and they handily displaced the other major military power on the continent, France, in the Franco-Prussian war. It was sort of like Imperial Japan. Germany got a late start on industry and militarization, but they rapidly advanced to the point that they had the largest military and biggest industrial base by the time WWi came around. Wars for supremacy had been going on in Europe for a long time, WWI was basically a continuation of that. The Austrians, the French and the Ottomans were losing ground as far as their influence on regional politics, and Germany was fighting for the top spot.

In World War 2, the Germans were at the forefront of combined arms tactics and rapid deployment, because they saw how disastrous a static war could be. They jumped up production on vehicles and tanka that could rapidly drop them in an area after its been softened by air support in what's called a blitzkrieg. The nations that Germany took over in WWII hadn't adapted to the changing tactics and tech. Other nations like Britain, the Soviets and the U.S. developed similar technology, but they were rocky with offensive tactics, which made attacking defended territory a big problem.

No plagiarism,"It's in English because the German Government were responding to the Boycott of German Goods campaign set in motion in March 1933 by various Jewish organisations, especially the America by the American Jewish Congress, American Jewish Committee, B'nai B'rith in the U.S. and similar groups in Britain.

A series of protest rallies were held on 27th March, 1933, with Madison Square Garden having 55,000 inside and outside the arena and parallel events held in 75 other cities across America.

Thus began the Boycott of German goods.

One of the best selling British newspapers, the Daily Express, ran the front page headline: ""Judea Declares War on Germany - Jews of All the World Unite - Boycott of German Goods - Mass Demonstrations."" The article described a forthcoming ""holy war"" and went on to implore Jews everywhere to boycott German goods and engage in mass demonstrations against German economic interests.

The Express said that Germany was ""now confronted with an international boycott of its trade, its finances, and its industry.... In London, New York, Paris and Warsaw, Jewish businessmen are united to go on an economic crusade.""

The article said ""worldwide preparations are being made to organise protest demonstrations,"" and reported that ""the old and reunited nation of Israel gets in formation with new and modern weapons to fight out its age old battle against its persecutors.""

In retaliation Minister of Propaganda, Dr Goebbels announced a one-day Boycott of Jewish Businesses in Germany to take place on 1st April, 1933, which would be lifted if anti-Nazi protests were suspended.

An International Jewish Boycott Conference was held in Amsterdam to coordinate the ongoing boycott campaign. It was held under the auspices of the self-styled World Jewish Economic Federation, however, the National Socialist - Zionist 'Haavara Agreement', together with lessened dependence on trade with the West, had by 1937 largely negated the effects of the Jewish boycott on Germany.",

No plagiarism,"A long time ago, there lived Hwanung, son of Hwanin, a man very interested in the lives of ordinary human beings. His father, well understanding Hwanung’s passion in mankind, lets him rule the human world. Hwanung went down to the summit of Taebaek mountain with 3 gods and a group of 3000. He called the summit area Sinshi. The 3 gods were Poongbaek, Wusa, and Wunsa. They were responsible for agriculture, long-living, diseases, punishment, and the good and evil etc.

Coincidently, a bear and a tiger lived together under a cave, praying to Hwanung to let them become human. So Hwanung gave them special wormwoods and garlic, then added “If you eat these for 100 days and stay away from sunlight, you shall permanently transform into human body.” Both kept to his words for 37 days, however at last only the bear transformed into a woman. The bear, named Woong-nyeu, wanted to have a child, so she begged once again. Hwanung temporarily transformed into human, married Woong-nyeu, then together gave birth to a baby boy. That boy grows up to become Dangun WangGum. He establishes Gojoseon.

Sources,"For one, native Americans didn't develop beyond subsistence, in an agricultural sense, and many tribes didn't urbanize into fixed settlements. Combine this with the efficacy of tribal medicine, and you have many small, numerically stable populations with a stone age infant mortality rate.

Their lands were settled by heavily urbanized, densely populated colonial powers used to raping the land for every scrap of food it can give, to feed a populace just well medicated enough to have a high growth rate.

Very swiftly settlers outnumbered the natives in North America, in good part due to myriad Old World diseases like Plague and Smallpox that battled each other for supremacy in the blood arenas that were dense european cities. Native Americans gave us such things like syphilis, but in general contact between groups was low enough to prevent the iterative development of pandemic grade germs.

Let me clarify: native populations had no contact at all with the old world Eurasia, unlike with the far East and Africa, where there was some genetic and viral transfer, for probably ten or twenty thousand years. They had functionally zero trained immunity to old world diseases, most of which developed well after the retreat of the ice shelves and the isolation of north american First Nations.

So yeah, a ravenous, disease ridden populace geared towards settlement, cooperation, and expansion versus sparse subsistance groups that were treated antagonistically, with a huge technological and organizational gap.

Even if you were so bold as to dump all native Americans under one demographic group, they were encroached upon by three or four such massive settler groups acting separately from one another. There was vanishingly little chance of them uniting against these forces, and that they still managed to do so under leaders like Tecumseh and Sitting Bull is a minor miracle unto itself.

So yeah, plague and shit got spread well beyond settlers, decimating the populace, and we then steamroller onto them with firearms and organized, regimented, well supplied military force.

I know ""guns, germs, and steel"" as a theory has its flaws, but those were major factors.

I flew only 6 days later from Cincinnati to Dallas. It was strange, a colleague who had the same route but did it earlier in the day actually called me on a 3 way call with a Delta agent because he heard the flight I usually took was not going to operate - definitely unusual.

The airport was empty as could be and the plane maybe had 20 people plus crew (a standard 737). I flew home two days later, same thing. The crew seemed genuinely happy to have anyone aboard. I flew that route regularly and it wasn't until Thanksgiving that the crowds really picked up again. After that, things returned back to normal with the changes to security added in.

Do not just post links or quotations,"Hi friend, I know nothing about this, but I've investigated and found some books and articles that cover this event.

The Book of Navajo by Raymond Friday Locke

Navaho Witchcraft (Navajo Witchcraft) by Clyde Kluckohn, which can be downloaded for free here, or previewed.

There is an article from the Arizona State University West literary magazine Paloverde called ""The Navajo Witch Purge of 1878"" by A. Lynn Allison which was written in 2001. I can't seem to find access to it though. Fun little snippit I found, though, is that I believe on of the Amazon reviewers for Martha Blue's book, which you mentioned, happens to be this mysterious article writer, A. Lynn Allison. On the review they're listed at Anita Lynn Dotson (possible married name?) who has supposedly met and spoke with Marth Blue. If they studied in similar fields, and such a niche subject as this, it's not surprising that they've met. Just thought that was funny I caught it.

These other books might cover this particular event. All of these, however, are still good historical context for the event.

The 1956 ""The Navajos"" by Ruth M. Underhill, which is no longer in print, but there a few not pricey copies online. Here's one on AbeBooks.

Navaho Legends by Washington Matthews

""Creation of First Man and First Woman"" by Washington Matthews, which is found in the book American Indians Myths and Legends which were selected and edited by Richard Erdoes and Alfonso Otriz. There's plenty of cheap copies on the internet, here's one from ebay.

All of these were found in Skinwalkers by Noah Nez, which talks briefly about this event, Navajo witchcraft in general, and why information is so scarce.

When I was first looking up this book and this event, I kept seeing stuff about skinwalkers pop up. So my advice is to research with that word instead of witch, and you might find more sources.
