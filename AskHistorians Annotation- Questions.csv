[text: My father does landscape work and was replacing someones patio. In the patio was a bird feeder on a long pole. Holding up the pole was a large chunk of metal. Turns out this chunk of metal was a 29"" long 550 pound cannon.

It took a while but the cannon is clean and ready to be fired. we will be firing it off this Saturday (August 25th) and I will record the event.

There are a few words on the outside of the cannon.

ON the barrle:

H (?) ATHORN

MASON CITY, IA

and there is a date on the base ring of the cannon. 1894 I believe it reads.

This was found in Minnesota.

So many pictures

Including some measurements.

Edit: All the concern for the safety of myself and those involved with the firing of the cannon is great. Thanks. We are going to have the cannon inspected by someone who knows his stuff. Unless we get the ok from him we will not be firing it. And even if we do fire it we will be using a small amount of gunpowder and no projectile.

The barrel seems to be in good condition: photo down the barrel

Edit 2 Video is up. We went to a gun range where there was lots of people shooting off cannons. They said it looked good so we fired it.

It wasn't until after he passed that I requested his records and unfortunately, his discharge papers are all that exists after a fire at the Army Records Center in ST. Louis. I guess I'd like to know if the battle citations listed on his discharge papers indisputably point to an individual's act of valor or if there is a possibility that this describes a different scenario such as a unit citation or some type of participation medal. I found a website which lists Silver Star recipients but his name was not on the list. Although he talked a lot about the countries he had been to, he never stuck me as someone who had seen a lot of action (no PTSD).

Privacy,"WW2: Is It Possible My Grandfather Did What He Said He Did? [text: My grandfather, a WW2 Army veteran, passed away in the early 2000's in his late 80s. He was anti-authoritarian, gruff, and a bit of an... exaggerator, shall we say.

 

I asked him once what he did in the Army; his response was ""Whatever they told me to do."" Because he was a braggart & an exaggerator, it was a bit unusual he didn't talk much about what he did in WW2. When it came to sorting out the truth, there wasn't much to work with.

 

Here are some of the things he told me:

    He was in the 15th Air Force.
    He participated in North Africa, Sicily, and the Italian campaign.
    He was part of a 4.2-inch chemical mortar crew.
    He sometimes flew around in stripped bombers with benches for passengers. B-17s were loud & very uncomfortable.
    ""They wheeled out those cannons & blew the hell out of us at Anzio.""
    ""Everyone called me Chief."" - This is probably because he was Cherokee (and listed in the Dawes Roll).
    He showed me 2 helmets & 2 Lugers he said he took from dead German soldiers beside an artillery gun a P-47 bombed. One helmet was in terrible condition, one was in very good shape with mottled camouflage & a white eagle on the side. He gave me one the bad one.
    He met Russian POWs, and ""Russians are a dirty people"". Ironically, he was the most racist man I've ever met.
    He had chemical burns on his hands & arms which he said was from mustard gas.
    He told me they fired tear gas at German bunkers to flush them out. He seemed to give an impression that was a major part of what they did.

 

Since he could fib (he convinced some veterans organizations he was a retired colonel), we were skeptical he was telling the truth. However, a few years ago I came upon some old photos & papers of his (which it looks like my father mistakenly threw away) and some of what he said checked out:

    He was assigned to a 4.2-inch mortar unit. I saw nothing that indicated what his duties were, and I don't remember a unit designation.
    He was part of the 15th Air Force.
    He had papers showing he had completed chemical weapons & disposal training.
    He had something that mentioned training with tear gas.
    There was a letter sent out by a (the?) commander to 15th Air Force servicemen. The first part of the letter was thanking them for their part in defeating Nazi Germany. The 2nd part began something like this: But there's another enemy to defeat. Prepare to be shipped out to the Pacific.
    He had photos of what looked like North African and/or Sicily. One of the photos showed palm trees with snow on them.
    He had another photo showing him sitting on a large artillery gun (possibly an 88mm?).
    He entered the war as a private & was discharged as a private.

 

I figure his chemical burns might be from disposing of chemical munitions. The part that has me confused is why he would be in the 15th Air Force and whether or not tear gas was used against the Germans. Weren't chemical munitions like that banned in WW2?

 

Any insight would be appreciated.]"
